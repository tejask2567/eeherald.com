                    <p>
                    Lumentum said it is  participating in a joint technical paper on Mobile Optical Pluggables (MOPA) with market-leading system providers Ericsson and Nokia and other industry participants.<br><br>MOPA paper explains common optical requirements for mobile transport networks including Mobile Optical Blueprints, which are network solution descriptions documenting use cases with the optical pluggable and passive optical components, such as wavelength division multiplexing and optical power splitter implementing these use cases, with high-level optical requirements.<br><br>To make the 5G a combination of optical and RF,  optical interface is required for 5G transport at fronthaul and backhaul. The challenge for operators, system vendors, and optical pluggable suppliers to make the right technology choices and focus on the most relevant needs. MOPA aims to help the ecosystem to ensure timely, cost-efficient, and optimized architectures.<br><br>"As high-capacity and cost-effective optical solutions are critical to 5G and next-generation mobile networks, we are excited to participate in defining industry requirements which will both help the industry advance and increase the market opportunities for our highly differentiated full-band tunable pluggable transceiver platform," said Justin Abbott, Lumentum Director of Product Line Management, Transmission. "Lumentum has a long history of innovation in high-speed full-band tunable pluggable transceivers, pioneering the category more than a decade ago. We are well-positioned to meet customer needs in 5G and next-generation mobile networks."<br><br>The link to technical white paper: https://www.lumentum.com/en/MOPA
