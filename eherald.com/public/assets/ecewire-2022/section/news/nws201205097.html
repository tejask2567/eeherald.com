                  <p class="title-text"> Telit's cellular module connects with CardioNet's MCOT to monitor patient's heart </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Telit Wireless Solutions has announced its CC864-DUAL cellular module will connect the next generation Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT) from CardioNet, Inc.<br><br>Enabled with cellular capabilities by the Telit module, the CardioNet MCOT captures and transmits cardiac data while the patient is fully ambulatory. The device provides heartbeat-by-heartbeat ECG monitoring, analysis and diagnosis from virtually anywhere, allowing patients to leave the hospital while maintaining physician access to vital medical information.<br><br>Physicians prescribe the CardioNet MCOT for up to 30 days, during which patients wear the device 24/7 for comprehensive monitoring and diagnosis. Sensors connected to the patient's body record cardiac events and transfer data to a small, handheld cellular device equipped with the Telit module. This handset then quickly and reliably sends the data back to the CardioNet Monitoring Center, staffed around-the-clock by expert technicians, for analysis and response.<br><br>"CardioNet's MCOT is a prime example of the enormous benefit cellular technology lends to healthcare practices, enabling immediate and responsive monitoring capabilities for physicians while helping patients avoid costly hospital stays," said Mike Ueland, senior vice president and general manager of Telit wireless solutions North America. "With these types of mHealth solutions, patients with chronic illnesses are now able to live their normal daily lives while experiencing premium care previously impossible outside the walls of a medical facility."<br><br>Telit's CC864-DUAL is a CDMA-1xRTT wireless module designed to have the same form, fit, and function as its GSM/GPRS and UMTS/HSDPA counterpart product families, the GC864 and the UC864 respectively, allowing integrators to achieve global deployment and service flexibility with a single design. The Telit CC864-DUAL is the platform for medium-to-high-volume m2m applications, mobile data and computing devices. Additional features such as integrated TCP/IP and UDP, a three-channel ADC and one-channel DAC provide extended functionality.
