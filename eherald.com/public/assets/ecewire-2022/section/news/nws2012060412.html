                    <p>
                    Mentor Graphics Corporation has announced the availability of its FloEFD v11.3 Concurrent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology, the embedded solution for PTC's Creo Parametric, Creo Elements/Pro, and Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire design software. Mentor Graphics FloEFD for Creo works directly with native PTC product geometry to keep pace with ongoing design changes. FloEFD for Creo allows users to maintain a single set of data across the entire project design flow since designers use the same geometry and a common user interface for CAD and analysis.<br><br>Simulation time can be reduced by as much as 65 to 75 percent in comparison to traditional CFD tools by using the FloEFD for Creo. Concurrent CFD enables users to optimize product performance and reliability while reducing physical prototyping and development costs without time or material penalties.<br><br>PTC customers using FloEFD for Creo will realize a wide range of physical simulation capabilities for fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, including a special module for electronics cooling applications with property libraries.<br><br>"As a 'Platinum' member of the PTC PartnerAdvantage Program, Mentor's Mechanical Analysis Division provides advanced CFD products that are seamlessly integrated with our products," stated Brian Thompson, vice president of MCAD Product Management from PTC. "Mentor's full support of FloEFD for Creo will help our customers eliminate design errors, reduce costs, and optimize designs involving heat transfer and fluid flow before physical prototypes."<br><br>"PTC is a valued technology partner and our FloEFD for Creo product enables our mutual customers to develop innovative products with minimized risk and higher productivity," stated Keith Hanna, director of marketing, Mechanical Analysis Division of Mentor Graphics. "Our seamless integration with PTC's products and our leading concurrent and upfront CFD technology are designed to help our customers get to market faster, and with confidence and reliable simulation results."<br><br>The FloEFD for Creo product is available. A free CFD software version is at http://www.mentor.com/products/mechanical/products/floefd/floefd-creo-trial-eval
