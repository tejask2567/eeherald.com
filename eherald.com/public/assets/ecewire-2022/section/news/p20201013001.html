                    IDC announced  availability of report of assessment of eleven companies offering the tools and frameworks for developing advanced machine learning (ML) models and solutions.  The eleven companies evaluated in this MarketScape report are: Alteryx, Amazon Web Services, Cloudera, Dataiku, DataRobot, Google, H2O.ai, IBM, MathWorks, Microsoft, and SAS.<br><br>"Success in the rapidly evolving AI software platforms market requires advanced machine learning software platform vendors to continue to innovate and provide tools to help customers accelerate development and deployment and monitoring of machine learning models," said David Schubmehl, research director, AI Software Platforms at IDC.<br><br>"AI adoption is past the tipping point. The rapid rise of digital transformation has pushed AI to the top of the corporate agenda and machine learning infusion is ubiquitous across all business processes," added Ritu Jyoti, program vice president for AI Research. "However, as we accelerate into the mainstream, organizations will need to embrace innovative machine learning platforms to realize AI/ML at scale and enjoy sustainable competitive advantage."<br><br>IDC says this assessment discusses both quantitative and qualitative characteristics that provide guidance about advanced machine learning software platform vendors and their offerings utilizing the IDC MarketScape framework.
