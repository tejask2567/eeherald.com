                    <p>
                    Fujitsu has announced that its senior researchers presenting their work at the European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC) and offer insight into the technical innovations enabling 400G and 1Tb optical communications. The ECOC conference taking place now (September 16-20) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands where leading optical transport researchers and technologies from around the world get together.<br><br>Fujitsu supports the optical communications industry with key research and technologies important to next generation carrier networks and the company has allocated more than $2 Billion annually to research and development. Fujitsu Laboratories’ researchers in Japan, China, and the US are to make multiple presentations spanning five key areas: High Speed DSP Compensation Techniques, Advanced Modulation, Flexible Modulation, High Speed Optical Components, and Next Generation Optical Network Architectures. The presentations symbolize years of study and experimentation.<br><br>“Our researchers enthusiastically accepted ECOC’s invitation to present the key technologies required for 400G and 1Tb high speed optical interfaces, Flexible Grid architectures, and Colorless – Directionless ROADMs”, commented Bill Erickson Sr. Vice President of Planning & Engineering at Fujitsu Network Communications. “One of Fujitsu’s core competencies is our commitment to fundamental optics research and innovation. It’s the foundation of our company and key to our product development. We are proud of our research achievements and the advancements they have enabled in the optical industry over the past 25 years, and the coming years look just as exciting.”
