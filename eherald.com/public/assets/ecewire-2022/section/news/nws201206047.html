                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    TDK Corporation has announced that the TDK-Lambda model HFE2500-48 power supply has now been certified to the 80 PLUS Platinum level for redundant, server, and data center applications.<br><br>The 80 PLUS performance specification requires power supplies to be 80% or greater energy efficient at 20%, 50% and 100% of rated load with a true power factor of 0.90. This makes 80 PLUS certified power supplies substantially more efficient than typical supplies.<br><br>The applications of HFE2500 series include data centers, wireless base stations, industrial automation, telecommunications, RF power amplifiers, network equipment, storage systems and distributed power architectures (DPA).<br><br>The HFE2500-48 operates with a nominal 230Vac input and provides a 48Vdc, 2500 watt, output and delivers over 92% efficiency at 20% load, 94% efficiency at 50% load, and over 92% efficiency at 100% load (see efficiency graph below). This supply exceeds the required power factor of 0.95 at 50% load with a measured power factor of 0.97.<br><br>Features:<br>1. Operate off a universal AC input from 85 to 265VAC, with active PFC<br>2. Provides regulated DC output of 12V, 24V or 48V<br>3. Has two temperature controlled variable-speed fans<br>4. Operating temperature range of -10°C to +70°C<br>5. Isolated I2C and PMBus interface<br>6. Opto-isolated signals are provided including DC-OK, AC-Fail and Over-Temperature<br>7. RoHS compliant<br>8. Carry the CE mark and meet UL/EN60950-1 safety specifications<br>9. Meets EN55022 and FCC class B EMC conducted specifications<br>10. Radiated EMC performance complies with class A requirements<br>11. Dimension of 1.61"H x 4.21"W x 12.8"L<br><br>Front-panel mounted LED indicators provide a visual status for DC-OK and AC-OK conditions. A remote On/Off control is also standard, as well as remote-sense to compensate for voltage drops in the cables that connect the supply outputs to the load. Other standard features include single wire current-share and an auxiliary 12V/0.5A output that is diode OR'd. Remote programming of the output voltage and current can be accomplished via the I2C and PMBus interface, or with an external 0-5V signal or a 1k ohm potentiometer.<br><br>The power supplies are available now at a price of $689.0 each in quantities of 100 units.<br><br>Product datasheets http://www.us.tdk-lambda.com/lp/products/hfe-series.htm
