                    <p>
                    Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. has announced a collection of 15 peripheral modules which plug directly into any FPGA/CPU expansion port that follows the Digilent Pmod standard. Plug-in simplicity and easy software integration permit fast prototyping and quick migration from concept to working design.<br><br>Maxim identifies that peripheral modules are becoming popular for circuit prototyping. This collection allows a variety of commonly used analog and mixed-signal functions. The modules are supported by example software and FPGA configuration files for three popular FPGA platforms.<br><br>Features of the modules:<br>1. Plug-in modules, FPGA configuration files, and example software are all included.<br>2. Software reduces development time. The example programs are partitioned and documented. The core routines can be cut and pasted which permits the module’s functionality to integrate into a designer’s own projects.<br>3. The collection includes functionality for data conversion, a digital potentiometer, real-time clock, light sensor, clock oscillator, thermal interface, communication transceivers, digital isolation, GPIO expansion, LED interface, and relay drivers.<br>4. Supported by software for Avnet LX-9, Digilent Nexys 3 and Avnet ZEDBoard<br>5. Operate at -40 Deg Cel to +85 Deg Cel<br><br>“These peripheral modules truly implement the concept of rapid prototyping and provide our customers more choices for quickly adding functionality to a board design,” said Dave Sackett, manager of Field Applications at Maxim Integrated Products. “This is the broadest, most diverse, and economical collection of modules in the semiconductor market today.”<br><br>“Maxim’s Analog Essentials collection of peripheral modules complements our Spartan-6 LX9 MicroBoard and upcoming ZedBoard, both of which incorporate several Pmod-compatible expansion connectors,” said Jim Beneke, vice president, Global Technical Marketing, Avnet Electronics Marketing. “Many FPGA systems require analog and mixed-signal interfaces to the real world, and this Pmod collection should belong in every FPGA designer’s toolkit.”<br><br>The price of the entire collection of 15 modules is $89.95. Each module can also be purchased individually.
