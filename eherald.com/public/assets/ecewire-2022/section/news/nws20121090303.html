                    <p>
                    Rambus Inc. has signed a patent license agreement with Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited. This six-year agreement covers the use of Rambus patented innovations implemented in a broad range of integrated circuit (IC) products provided by Fujitsu Semiconductor. Financial terms of the agreement are confidential.<br><br>"As a global leader in the semiconductor market, Fujitsu Semiconductor is an important customer and this agreement validates the continued strength of our portfolio," said Dr. Ronald Black, chief executive officer of Rambus. "We look forward to the opportunity to expand our customer relationships beyond patent license agreements to showcase our technical contributions and system know-how with our customers."<br><br>Rambus has been developing solutions since 1990 that advance electronic system performance through innovations in logic and memory interfaces, controller architectures, and system design. The result is a broad portfolio of patented innovations that helps semiconductor manufacturers and system designers to achieve increasing levels of functionality and performance, to lower system costs, to mitigate risk with silicon-proven designs, and to reduce time-to-market.<br><br>Source: Rambus
