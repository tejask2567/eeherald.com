                  <p class="title-text"> NXP drives MIFARE for broader range of applications </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    NXP Semiconductors N.V. has made available of MIFARE4Mobile as an embedded applet on the latest and upcoming NXP embedded secure elements to support mobile ticketing for the sizeable MIFARE Classic system install base worldwide. The solution is available now in NXP's newest stacked solution the PN65O, incorporating the bestselling PN544 NFC controller and recently enhanced SmartMX based P5 secure application platform (embedded secure element).<br><br>NXP says the MIFARE technology platform has become the most widely adopted contactless technology on the market today and is an essential element in public transportation schemes, ticketing systems, loyalty programs, and access management as well as more than 40 other applications around the world. Through a comprehensive licensing program the MIFARE technology platform is available on several form factors, including embedded secure element, UICC SIM and micro SD, from different vendors.<br><br>Initially developed by NXP Semiconductors, MIFARE4Mobile is a technology which is used to manage MIFARE-based services such as transit ticketing, access management and loyalty, in NFC enabled mobile devices, from over-the-air installation to end-user interaction via the user interface of the mobile phone. MIFARE4Mobile is guided by the MIFARE4Mobile Industry Group, which was formed by leading players in the NFC ecosystem in 2010, and is currently defining the next evolution of MIFARE4Mobile specifications. The upcoming specifications aim to support additional MIFARE technology platform products and compliance to global standards such as Global Platform.<br><br>The currently published MIFARE4Mobile specification is V1.01 and has the capability to serve MIFARE Classic based infrastructures. In its first MIFARE4Mobile applet implementation, NXP Semiconductors extended V1.01 features to allow for multiple service providers within one secure element.<br><br>"The availability of MIFARE4Mobile on our PN65O complements NXP's NFC and transit industry leadership and reflects the commitment NXP has to enable convergence of mobile and transit use cases. With the majority of leading smart phone OEMs launching NFC handsets, network operators and transit authorities' interest in mobile ticketing continues to rise. Making MIFARE4Mobile available on NXP embedded secure elements and interoperable with the worldwide MIFARE Classic infrastructure is just the start. We look forward to enhancing this offering as the MIFARE4Mobile specifications continue to evolve as part of our industry leadership," commented Jeff Miles, vice president, mobile transactions, NXP Semiconductors.<br><br>"NFC technology supporting MIFARE DESFire and Classic continue to be of substantial interest to transit agencies to enable a secure application for interoperable mobile ticketing and payment. We are pleased to see the introduction of NXP's solution with MIFARE4Mobile as a viable way to bring mobile ticketing, payment, and related applications to transit users," David deKozan, vice president, strategic initiatives, Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc. Cubic is a leading integrator of payment and information technology and services for intelligent travel solutions with a global customer base of transport operators in cities that include San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, London, Vancouver, Atlanta, Brisbane and Sydney.<br><br>Near Field Communication (NFC) continues to gain widespread global acceptance with over 45% attach rate of smart phones by 2015 (Source: ABI). NFC-enabled handsets have increasingly become mainstream products for consumers while contactless applications - including payment, transit ticketing and access management - continue to grow in popularity. Being the industry leader, NXP is at the forefront of security and NFC technology with better performance, smaller footprint, and smaller antenna and package optimization.
