                  <p class="title-text"> Broadcom joins HP ProActive Insight Architecture (PIA) Alliance </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Broadcom Corporation has announced it is a founding member of the HP ProActive Insight Architecture (PIA) Alliance, selected by HP for its latest generation of 1GbE and 10GbE NetXtreme controllers developed to the HP standards and interfaces that contribute to the industry-transforming performance and reliability of HP ProLiant Generation 8 (Gen8).<br><br>HP ProActive Insight Architecture, now available in the new HP ProLiant Gen8 servers, transforms data center economics with built-in intelligence that improves performance and uptime, while lower operating costs. Broadcom would continue to contribute to the elimination of common problems caused by human-to-technology interaction that lead to system downtime and data loss. Through embedded HP ProLiant Gen8 server technology, HP PIA Alliance members, along with HP, can evaluate data and other critical analytics to continually optimize and improve on business results.<br><br>The HP PIA Alliance brings together the collective value of the technology innovators to complement HP ProLiant Gen8 servers. Alliance members, drawn from leaders in memory, storage, I/O, power and infrastructure solutions, build technology components to HP Proactive Insight architecture standards and interfaces. These components help to analyze thousands of system parameters and automate processes that consume critical data center resources. Additionally, they provide insight into aspects of application performance and IT infrastructure optimization that had once been nearly impossible to capture and utilize.<br><br>"Rising demand for server virtualization, cloud computing, and I/O intensive applications are driving the need for greater processing and automation capabilities in the data center and enterprise networks," said Vinod Lakhani, general manager, High Speed Controllers at Broadcom Corporation. "We're honored to have a seat at the table in driving and defining next generation networking technology together with the expertise of industry leaders throughout the space."<br><br>"The cost of manual operations and system optimization needed to support growing IT requirements is unsustainable," said Jim Ganthier, vice president, marketing and operations, Industry Standard Servers and Software at HP. "The PIA Alliance brings together some of the world's leading technology companies to eliminate manual maintenance tasks and significantly improve data center efficiency."<br><br>Broadcom would use the HP PIA qualified insignia as visible assurance of meeting HP's quality and performance standards. The HP PIA Alliance will be featured at HP's premier client event, HP Discover, which takes place June 4-7 in Las Vegas.
