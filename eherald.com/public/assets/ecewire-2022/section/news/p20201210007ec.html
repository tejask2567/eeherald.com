                    <p>
                    Automated driving technology start-up AImotive is using a range of latest Synopsys EDA tools such as VCS simulation and Verdi debug to  verify its innovative aiWare Neural Network (NN) accelerator silicon IP which can be part of a SOC chip  or a separate  camera-centric AI device for the purpose of advanced driver assistance systems.  <br><br>Along with the silicon aiWare hardware IP, AImotive is offering software, simulator for automotive OEMs to quickly develop automated driving systems. aiDrive is a modular automated driving software stack and aiSim is a simulation and design validation environment built around its proprietary physics-accurate rendering engine. <br><br>Synopsys tools helping Aimotive to meet aggressive goals for verification of a range of scalable implementations of aiWare as required by their different automotive customers.<br><br>"Aimotive's products are developed to the most demanding standards such as ISO 26262 to solve some of the toughest automated driving challenges to the highest levels of robustness under all operating conditions," said Marton Feher, SVP hardware engineering at Aimotive. "The integration of VCS with Verdi debug delivered superior performance and improved regression turn-around time, enabling us to significantly improve overall productivity as well as accelerate new product development projects. The ability to natively compile in VCS and leverage unified debug in Verdi, alongside industry-wide recognition of VC SpyGlass for validating our RTL for multiple foundries and customers made Synopsys' functional verification solutions an excellent choice for our needs." <br><br>Synopsys' Verdi links tests and checks to industry standard specifications like ISO 26262, helping developers to save that time of the process. Synopsys' VC SpyGlass platform picks critical design issues at early stage including design reuse compliance checks such as STARC and OpenMORE to enforce a consistent style throughout the design, ease the integration and promote design reuse, as per Synopsys.<br><br>"Synopsys is addressing the need for faster time-to-market with our leading portfolio of verification software technologies," said Rajiv Maheshwary, VP of marketing and business development in the Verification Group at Synopsys. "We are pleased to support Aimotive as it enables more rapid deployment of advanced automated driving technology."
