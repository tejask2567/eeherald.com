                    <p>
                    IPC’s National Conference on Electronics Design, Assembly and Reliability (NCEDAR), to be held December 4–6, 2012, at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India, to provide information on state-of-the-art technologies in printed circuit board design and manufacturing.<br><br>Technical conference sessions on December 5-6 will focus on six areas of advanced electronics: design, simulation and modeling; electronic components, RF and optoelectronics; PCB assembly and manufacturing technology; materials and processing; reliability and quality control; and advanced packaging including interconnections.<br><br>Prof. G.V. Mahesh, principal research scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, will present on high-performance PCBs with high-density interconnections, advanced packages and embedded passives technology. “Industry is moving toward high-density packages like BGA, CSP and PoP. Substrates need to match in terms of high-density interconnects (HDI) and organic substrates,” Mahesh says. Mahesh will also cover embedded passives and notes that while many handled products routinely embed resistors and capacitors in substrates, in India there are designs with embedded passives for volume manufacturing. “Indian manufacturers don’t currently do much in this area, but this could change fast,” he adds.<br><br>In addition to Mahesh’s presentation, other industry experts from Intel, the India Research Center, Indian Space Research Organisation and GE Intelligent Platforms will cover such topics as: CAD and signal integrity; high speed interconnect optimization; innovative thermal management techniques for electronics packaging; jetting solder paste and SMT production; multilayer ceramic chip capacitor assembly reliability and ball grid array assemblies for space.<br><br>Three workshops on December 4 precede the technical conference. Workshop presenters will provide in-depth discussion on critical areas including surface mount process development and yield enhancement for advanced packages; signal and power integrity for high performance designs and electronic packaging materials and processes.<br><br>Exhibitors including Altium, GOEPEL Electronic, Hakko, Kyzen, Mentor Graphics and Sienna Corporation will be on-hand to present equipment, systems and supplies to help attendees solve electronics manufacturing challenges. Special events during the conference include an opening keynote by Dr. V.K. Aatre, former scientific advisor to Raksha Mantri at the India Ministry of Defense, three additional keynote sessions, a PCB design contest and an IPC Hand Soldering Competition.<br><br>Registration for NCEDAR is open online.
