                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    CEVA, Inc. has joined the Wi-Fi Alliance to further advocate for a software-based Wi-Fi strategy. This follows on from the company's recent announcement of a new software-based, reference architecture targeting multi-mode Wi-Fi 802.11 mobile stations (STA) and access points (AP) together with partner Antcor, S.A. CEVA's Wi-Fi reference architecture is based on the new CEVA-XC4000 DSP architecture framework.<br><br>"We congratulate CEVA, Inc. on becoming a member of Wi-Fi Alliance," said Edgar Figueroa, CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. "By joining our organization, CEVA has demonstrated its commitment to advancing Wi-Fi technology while preserving a great user experience."<br><br>"The advent of the next generation of Wi-Fi standards including 802.11ac poses new challenges for the development of multi-standard, high performance Wi-Fi enabled SoCs," said Eran Briman, vice president of marketing at CEVA. "The continuous evolvement of these standards together with greater processing requirements dictates a new silicon design approach that will enable semiconductor companies to reduce development time, minimize risk and also extend products' life-cycle. CEVA believes that a software-based Wi-Fi approach based on the CEVA-XC4000 DSP architecture framework is the optimal way to address both the performance and flexibility issues with current hardwired designs and we look forward to sharing our expertise in this area with the Wi-Fi Alliance and its members."<br><br>The CEVA-XC4000 is a fully programmable low-power DSP architecture framework supporting the communication standards including LTE-Advanced, LTE and HSPA+, alongside Wi-Fi, DTV demodulation, white space, smart grid, etc., The CEVA-XC4000 architecture is offered in a series of six fully programmable DSP cores.
