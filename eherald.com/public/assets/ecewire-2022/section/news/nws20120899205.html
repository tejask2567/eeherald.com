                    <p>
                    Vivante Corporation has said it has joined the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Foundation. The HSA (Heterogeneous System Architecture) Foundation is a not-for-profit consortium for SoC IP vendors, OEMs, academia, SoC vendors, OSVs and ISVs whose goal is to make it easy to program for parallel computing.<br><br>Vivante said its HSA design will be built on a unified software and hardware package that provides a single architecture spanning multiple operating systems and platforms. Vivante HSA software also to be backward compatibility with all existing compute-enabled products and built around HSA APIs and tools that complement Vivante's existing support of OpenCL, Google Renderscript, and Microsoft DirectCompute. Vivante cores are used in designing systems such as computer vision, image processing, augmented reality, sensor fusion, and motion processing.<br><br>“We welcome Vivante to the HSA Foundation as a valued member of our consortium of technology leaders driving the next generation of heterogeneous computing platforms,” said Phil Rogers, HSA Foundation President and AMD Corporate Fellow. “Vivante’s products and technologies will enhance HSA and help expand its footprint into a wide range of markets, bringing new capabilities of hybrid systems to Vivante’s customers.”<br><br>“Vivante is excited to join HSA Foundation as a technology contributor defining the next era of innovation built on heterogeneous computing,” said Wei-Jin Dai, President and CEO of Vivante. “We are already one of the industry leaders in mobile and embedded GPU and Compute technologies – currently the only company with mass market GPU IP that pass OpenCL 1.1 conformance and the only company that has partners shipping OpenGL ES 3.0 silicon. We look forward to collaborating with the consortium to define the next generation architecture for smartphones, tablets, TV/STB, embedded, networking, cloud computing, and automotive.”
