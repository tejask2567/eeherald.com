                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Sofics bvba and ICsense have announced that NVIDIA has licensed their integrated ESD and I/O technology to provide a stable 3.3V I/O with robust ESD protection on its Icera modem processors that use 1.8V transistors .<br><br>The license includes customized ESD solutions from Sofics and ICsense's overvoltage-tolerant I/Os. These solutions are based on a novel circuit technique proven in TSMC 0.18um, 40nm, and 28nm processes that allows I/Os to handle more than 2X the voltage of the transistors on the chip.<br><br>"Our baseband modem needs to interface with legacy components in smartphones and tablets, such as SIM cards and memory cards. Sofics and ICsense came up with a solution for us that works at high voltages and provides good ESD protection. This enables us to handle off-chip interfaces of up to 3.6 volts, even for non-standard multimedia interfaces like HDMI and USB 3.0," said Pete Hughes, Vice President, Mobile, NVIDIA.<br><br>"We are very pleased that NVIDIA has chosen to extend Icera's license for this truly novel technology," said Bram De Muer, ICsense CEO. "It's a testimony to how successfully this family of overvoltage-tolerant I/Os integrates our analog, high-voltage-in-low-voltage design discipline with ESD protection expertise from Sofics."<br><br>Integration of overvoltage tolerance with ESD protection delivers both technical and cost benefits, according to Sofics CEO Koen Verhaege.<br><br>"On the technology side, our collaborative approach to the technology has produced overvoltage-tolerant I/Os with low leakage and low capacitance, while offering high-speed operation with transistors from 0.85V to 1.8V," said Verhaege. "Our cost advantages are just as compelling. There's no development cost. There's no shuttle cost. The technology is silicon-proven and product-proven, its IP is clean, and it uses standard processes."<br><br>"It's generally much less costly to license our technology than develop your own."
