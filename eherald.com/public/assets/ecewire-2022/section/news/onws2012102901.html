                    <p>
                    At the recently held CDN Live 2012 user event from Cadence, Jaswinder Ahuja, CVP and MD, Cadence India said "It's very exciting time for all of us to be part of electronics and semiconductor industry." Lip-Bu Tan President and Chief Executive Officer of Cadence Design Systems has shared key trends in the electronics and semiconductor industry, some of the trends he shared includes:<br><br>Consolidation trend: Semiconductor industry has $130 Billion cash to acquire businesses.<br><br>System companies are going in the direction of vertical integration and creating more opportunity for chip design talent.<br><br>China and India treating semiconductor as strategic areas resulting in growth of the industry.<br><br>Mobile device is finding it way into lot more new applications resulting in one person owning multiple mobile devices. Cloud computing offering enormous opportunity. All these driving massive parallelism and multicore at low power in VLSI design.<br><br>Lip-Bu Tan said "In next 10 years the best product to come from India. I look forward for next Apple of the world from India. This is very exciting."<br><br>This writer asked Lip-Bu Tan, is there any effort to reduce the design-time of a complex semiconductor chip from weeks/months to hours/days. Lip-Bu Tan said they are working on that. Presently its taking months for a complete tape-out of SoC class chip.<br><br>On the consolidation trend of Synopsys acquiring Magma, EVE, and Springsoft, he said they are delighted about Synopsys acquiring these players.
