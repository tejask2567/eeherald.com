                    Infonetics Research, a market research firm, has released excerpts from its recent 10G/40G/100G optical transceivers market size and forecast. The firm tracks 10 Gigabit, 40 Gigabit, and nascent 100 Gigabit optical transceivers and transponders sold into the optical transport, enterprise, and carrier routing and switching markets.<br><br>"2012 will be a pivotal year for 100G design activity, with many new equipment vendors fielding production equipment," expects Andrew Schmitt, principal analyst for optical at Infonetics Research. "This will drive volume in the component world in 2013 as carriers reboot their optical networks and roll out all-coherent networks. In the meantime, 10G WDM interface growth continues with the tunable XFP playing the lead role, while 10G SFP+ volumes in the data center explode."<br><br>Optical transceiver market highlights<br>1. Infonetics Research forecasts the global 10G, 40G, and 100G optical transceiver market to grow to $3.3 billion by 2016<br>2. Unit shipments of 10G SFP+ modules nearly doubled in 2011 compared to 2010, and are expected to grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate through 2016<br>3. Tunable XFP shipments nearly tripled in 2011, spurred by the entry of multiple new suppliers<br>4. Unit shipments of WDM-capable modules grew 24% in 2011 over 2010<br>5. The 100G coherent transceiver market is set to surge as supply floods the market in 2012, led by network equipment manufacturers (NEMs)<br><br>The report analyzes the market by module, reach, wavelength, and form factor.
