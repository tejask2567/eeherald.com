                    <p>
                    Sony Corporation and Panasonic Corporation have announced that they have signed an agreement regarding the joint development of next-generation OLED (organic light-emitting diode) panels and modules for TVs and large-sized displays.<br><br>Sony and Panasonic aim to jointly develop next-generation OLED panels and modules by each using their core and printing technologies. They plan to jointly develop printing method-based next-generation OLED technology for low-cost mass production of large, high resolution OLED panels and modules. Sony and Panasonic aspire to set up mass-production technology during 2013 by integrating their technologies.<br><br>Sony released the first OLED TV in 2007 with its 11-inch model and a 25-inch professional OLED monitor in 2011. Sony has encouraged the research and development of next-generation OLED technologies such as hybrid OLED element devices and processing (manufacturing) technologies that combine deposition and printing methods, thin film transistor (TFT) drivers such as oxide TFTs, and flexible organic TFTs.<br><br>Panasonic develops large-sized screen, high-resolution OLED panels and uses the cutting-edge "all printing method". Panasonic owns the unique production and equipment technologies which enable the production of OLED panels through this method. Panasonic is also carrying out research and development of advancements in flexible OLED panels and aiming to develop large-sized, high quality sheet-type displays.<br><br>Sony and Panasonic also plan to continue to study collaboration in the mass production of OLED panels and modules. Also, they plan to use their strengths to develop and commercialize their own next-generation OLED televisions and large-sized displays.<br><br>Source: Panasonic
