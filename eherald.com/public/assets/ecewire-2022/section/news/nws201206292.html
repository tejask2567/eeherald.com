                    <p>
                    Maxim Integrated Products has announced some important heterogeneous network (HetNet) solutions needed for next-generation base-station equipment. The solutions consist of single-chip multiband radio transceivers, broadband gain blocks, direct RF synthesis DACs, and intelligent, digital, point-of-load controllers.<br><br>The cellular radio access network (RAN) is evolving to a heterogeneous network that insists a set of diverse analog and mixed-signal base-station solutions needed for the main radio signal paths, baseband processing support, and power-conversion nodes. Maxim has foreseen the HetNet evolution and provides new solutions that deliver solid analog integration.<br><br>HetNet is the synchronized operation of critical 3G/4G wireless infrastructure elements comprising macro cell and small cell base stations, residential femto cells, and mobile backhaul. The network elements operate in concert to deliver the high data throughput, high mobility, and the exceptional quality of experience that mobile broadband subscribers expect from the 3G/4G network. With exploding mobile media and data consumption patterns, subscribers to experience ubiquitous, reliable, and seamless connectivity from the HetNet architecture.<br>Maxim solutions for the HetNet:<br>1. MAX2550–MAX2553 single-chip small-cell radio transceivers<br>2. MAX5879 direct RF synthesis DAC for multicarrier, multiband, and multistandard macro cell, small cell, and wireless backhaul transmitters<br>3. MAX2870 ultra-wideband 23.5MHz to 6000MHz synthesizer with integrated VCO<br>4. MAX15301 InTune digital point-of-load controller with automatic compensation, integrated FET driver, and integrated PMBus telemetry<br>5. MAX2612–MAX2616 broadband, 40MHz to 4000MHz gain blocks<br><br>J. Madden, principal analyst of Mobile Experts said: “During 2010, the number of terabytes of mobile data exceeded the terabytes of voice data for the first time. And with the tsunami of demand for mobile data, operators are changing their focus to indoor and small-cell deployments to increase capacity. The network of the future is a ‘HetNet.’” (Madden, J., “Semiconductors for Small Cells,” Mobile Experts, October 2011, p. 14.)<br><br>Vickram Vathulya, managing director in Maxim’s Communications Solutions Group explained: “Maxim is in a unique position. We are leveraging our experience in IC integration to deliver disruptive high-performance technologies and differentiated solutions for a successful HetNet rollout.”<br><br>For more information: www.maxim-ic.com/HetNet
