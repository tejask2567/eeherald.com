                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Synopsys, Inc has announced the successful collaboration between Synopsys and Samsung Electronics on the implementation of an ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore processor. The processor core was implemented by Samsung Austin Research Center (SARC) using Synopsys IC compiler place-and-route technology.<br><br>Running at operating speeds in excess of a gigahertz on Samsung's 32nm low power process, the hardened core has been deployed in the Cortex-A15 processor-based SoC for mobile computing devices.<br><br>"Our mission is to deliver the highest frequency while minimizing power for high-end processor and graphics cores targeted to the mobile computing and digital home markets," said Keith Hawkins, vice president, SARC. "Globally, this was the first production tapeout of a Cortex-A15 processor and we relied exclusively on IC Compiler and the Galaxy tool suite to predictably achieve our performance and power targets."<br><br>Samsung fabricated the three-million-instance, dual-core Cortex-A15 processor on a 32LP high-K metal gate (HKMG) process. Synopsys collaborated closely with SARC on an implementation methodology based on performance technologies and optimization techniques in the Galaxy implementation platform.<br><br>"Samsung is a leading provider of silicon in the mobile computing market, as can be seen by its smart phone and tablet market penetration," said Antun Domic, senior vice president and general manager, implementation group at Synopsys. "Being at the forefront of next generation mobile products, Samsung has driven many of the technology innovations that have reinforced the position of IC Compiler as the leading choice for high-performance design. The benefits of our ongoing partnership can be seen in the impressive level of performance delivered by this gigahertz-plus processor core."
