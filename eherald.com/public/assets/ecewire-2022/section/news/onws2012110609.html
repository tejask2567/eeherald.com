                  <p class="title-text"> Open-Silicon uses Cadence Encounter to achieve 2.2 GHz on dual-core Cortex -A9 </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cadence Design Systems has announced that Open-Silicon has used Cadence Encounter RTL-to-signoff flow to achieve 2.2 GHz performance on a 28-nanometer hardening of an ARM dual-core Cortex -A9 processor.<br><br>Open-Silicon used the latest Encounter digital RTL-to-signoff products for the processor core which is targeted for mobile computing applications, including RTL Compiler-Physical (RC-Physical) and Encounter Digital Implementation (EDI) System. Cadence says EDI System features advanced GigaOpt optimization and Clock Current Optimization (CCOpt) technologies, which, together with RC-Physical, helped reduce the design area by 10 percent, clock tree power by 33 percent and overall leakage power by 27 percent compared to a prior flow, while accelerating design closure by two weeks.<br><br>“Improving designer productivity and time-to-market are absolutely critical to Open-Silicon’s rapid execution of SoC development. The predictability of the Cadence RTL-to-Sign-off flow, which includes excellent convergence from RC-Physical to EDI System and Encounter Timing System (ETS) for sign-off, has enhanced Open-Silicon’s competitive advantage in delivering industry-leading ARM processor-based SoC designs,” said Taher Madraswala, senior vice president of engineering at Open-Silicon. “Achieving 2.2 GHz under typical conditions on the ARM dual-core Cortex-A9 processor at advanced nodes and in a short turn-around time is a testament to Open-Silicon and Cadence’s capabilities and collaborative efforts. The PPA and runtime improvement as a result of adopting Encounter GigaOpt and CCOpt technologies in our CoE chip design flows is a real game changer.”<br><br>“We congratulate Open-Silicon on this significant achievement, and thank them for partnering with Cadence to optimize PPA for the world’s most sophisticated and complex ARM processor-based designs,” said Dr. Chi-Ping Hsu, senior vice president, research and development, Silicon Realization Group at Cadence. “In collaboration with our partners, Cadence is focused intently on enabling customers to implement high-performance processors that power many of today’s popular electronic products.”
