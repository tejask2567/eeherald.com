                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    MathWorks has announced that Simulink code generation targets have been built into Freescale's motor control development toolbox through Embedded coder. The toolbox, consisting of Simulink motor control blocks and target-ready code generation support, lets automotive and industrial controls engineers design motor control systems using Freescale microprocessors in IEC 61508 (SIL3) and ISO 26262 (ASIL-D) compliant systems.<br><br>Motor algorithms can be designed as well as configure and generate the software needed to execute the algorithms on any Freescale MPC5643L or PXS20 hardware platform using the motor control development toolbox. The toolbox offers optimized code generation and support for model-in-the-loop (MIL), software-in-the-loop (SIL) and processor-in-the-loop (PIL) testing through Embedded coder from MathWorks.<br><br>"Our automotive and industrial automation processors are increasingly deployed by engineers who use model-based design," said Steve Pancoast, vice president of product solutions for Freescale's automotive, industrial and multi-market solutions group. "The blocks in the motor control development toolbox represent years of motor control IP, and now with the toolbox, engineers can automatically implement, verify, and optimize their designs for Freescale's newest processors."<br><br>The motor control development toolbox supports the MPC564xL, MPC567xK and PXS30 and PXS20 MCU families.<br><br>Block libraries in motor control development toolbox provide base math functions including trigonometry, PI controllers, FIR and IIR filters, and motor control operations including Park and Clarke transforms. Peripheral block support includes ADC and PWM, as well as SPI and CAN buses.<br><br>The generated C source code can be automatically built with Freescale CodeWarrior IDE, Wind River Diab, Green Hills Software MULTI, and other compilers. For examining software on target hardware, the toolbox provides FreeMASTER, which enables parameter tuning, real-time monitoring, and data logging.
