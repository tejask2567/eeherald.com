                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Technologies Ltd has announced a new type of point-to-point high speed interface for use within LCD display panels. The new Scalable Intra Panel Interface (SIPI) achieves high data rate, low power use, and reduced interference with embedded system wireless services for ultra-thin, high pixel density mobile displays.<br><br>Parade says that SIPI is advantageous over the intra panel interfaces including the mini-LVDS (mini Low Voltage Differential Signaling) interface. SIPI incorporates an embedded data clock through use of 8B/10B data encoding instead of relying on a separate data clock signal. The combination of 8B/10B encoding and data scrambling reduces Electromagnetic Interference and Radio Frequency Interference. This addresses the ongoing challenge of inference with embedded wireless services, including GPS services.<br><br>SIPI was designed to be scalable with microchip technology by enabling support for decreasing supply voltages as process geometries continue to shrink in display panel chips. SIPI is also compatible with Chip-On-Glass (COG) technology, which panel makers are increasingly adopting to meet the demands of the thin-and-light mobile system market.<br><br>One-wire Auxiliary Status Channel (ASC) that provides back-channel communication from the source/column driver SIPI receiver to the TCON is another feature of SIPI. Through its ability to report the data error rate at the SIPI receiver, ASC facilitates automatic panel and system-level testing during manufacturing, as well as system debugging and status checking.<br><br>"Parade has maintained leadership in the DisplayPort (DP) and Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) enabled TCON market," explained Jimmy Chiu, executive VP of marketing at Parade Technologies. "While DP and eDP removed the data bottleneck between the motherboard GPU and the TCON input, there was still no optimized solution for the TCON output, especially for the new higher-resolution, COG panels. Ongoing evaluation of the SIPI technology with our key panel customers indicates we have found a promising solution to this problem. We think this will further enable the high resolution mobile market."<br>Future Parade TCON chips would feature SIPI as an output interface and they would be supported by future source/column driver chips. LCD display panel prototypes incorporating SIPI are expected to be available in late 2012. LCD panel makers in Asia are adopting this new SIPI interface.
