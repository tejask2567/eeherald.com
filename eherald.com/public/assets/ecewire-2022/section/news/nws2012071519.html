                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Teradyne has selected the MPAC (Magnum Precision Analog Channel) instrument for Teradyne's Magnum family of test systems. Teradyne says MPAC offers analog source and analog capture capability as well as a voltage reference for multiple test applications including embedded converters. For increased test system configuration flexibility, the MPAC can be ordered with up to 48 channels of source/capture/Vref or with 24 channels of source/capture/Vref plus 32 device power supply channels. The MPAC also includes an integrated parametric measurement unit (PMU) available at any instrument channel.<br><br>"The MPAC instrument adds functional test coverage on the Magnum platform, enabling us to reduce the number of production test insertions which results in lower cost of production test,” said Doug Foster, director of Product Engineering, Lattice Semiconductor. “As we extend Lattice’s product lines with added analog peripherals and functionality, Teradyne has responded by offering a high-density precision analog instrument to the Magnum while preserving its unique, scalable ATE architecture to deliver lower cost of production test."<br><br>"Teradyne is dedicated to working closely with its customers to ensure that our ATE solutions deliver the test coverage they need while maintaining superior cost of test economics," said Jason Zee, general manager of Teradyne’s Consumer Business Unit. “We are pleased to offer Lattice the additional analog test capability they need with the addition of MPAC instrument to the Magnum product line.”
