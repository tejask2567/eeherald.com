                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Fabless semiconductor company Alchip has licensed Panasonic' new version of power line communication tech HD-PLC Eco. Panasonic says the new HD-PLC Eco technology realizes about 90% reduction of power consumption in comparison to its existing HD-PLC adapters (BL-PA510) that has 4 watt power consumption. This version also claimed to be more stable and secure making HD-PLC Eco suitable for application in power meters for smart grid systems and electric vehicles.<br><br>Panasonic said it first began licensing its HD-PLC technology in 2010 and has since seen an expansion of the HD-PLC solution with examples such as the beginning of the sales of IEEE 1901*2 compliant HD-PLC LSI by Japanese LSI manufacturers.<br><br>"By taking advantage of HD-PLC, Alchip customers will be able to maximize the efficiency of their low-power and energy efficient SoC designs " said Johnny Shen, the President and CEO of Alchip, "As a trusted silicon partner, we commit to support our customers in realizing their innovations and achieving success. This collaboration between Panasonic and Alchip extends our value proposition to our customers with the best in class silicon solutions for a greener, energy efficient, smart community".
