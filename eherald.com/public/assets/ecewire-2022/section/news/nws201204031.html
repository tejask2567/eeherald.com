                    <p>
                    This year's popular semiconductor event 'SEMICON West' going to be held on July 10-12 to feature the latest developments in <22nm process development and lithography in keynote presentations and free on-floor TechXPOT sessions.<br><br>Shekhar Borkar, director of Extreme-scale Technologies at Intel Labs, to provide the technology keynote at 9:00am on Tuesday, July 10, discussing Intel's mid- and long-term IC development efforts in scaling, power reduction, and performance improvements. Separate two-hour TechXPOT sessions will be held on the latest technical achievements, challenges and barriers in photolithography, and advanced materials and processes for <22nm production.<br><br>The release states "Mobile and cloud computing are among the key drivers of the semiconductor industry. With conventional scaling approaching its physical limits, the challenge falls to advanced materials and processes - and transistor architectures - to continue the drive to faster/smaller/thinner devices. The SEMICON West South Hall TechXPOT session at 10:30am on Tuesday, July 10 will examine trends and issues with fully-depleted devices (e.g., FDSOI, FinFETs, tri-gate, etc.) and the use of III-V channel materials"<br><br>The below speakers to discuss the latest developments, continued challenges, and ongoing research efforts in advanced process technology:<br>Raj Jammy, VP, Materials and Emerging Technologies, SEMATECH<br>Carlos Mazuré, EVP and CTO, Soitec<br>Kaizad Mistry, VP, director of Logic Technology Integration, Intel<br>Aaron Thean, director, Logic Program, imec<br><br>Lithography challenges to be discussed on Wednesday, July 11 at 10:30am in the South Hall TechXPOT session. Industry experts to examine continued efforts to commercialize EUVL, including productivity improvements, EUV transmission and conversion efficiency, and input power progress. Additionally, EUV mask and resist infrastructure readiness activities, extension of double-patterning and the role of complementary technologies, such as e-beam lithography, to be addressed by the following speakers:<br>Yan Borodovsky, senior Intel fellow, director, Advanced Lithography, Intel<br>Stefan Wurm, director, Lithography, SEMATECH<br>Hans Meiling, director, Product Management EUV, ASML<br>Franklin Kalk, CTO, Toppan Photomasks<br>Serge Tedesco, IMAGINE (MAPPER), program manager, CEA-Leti<br>Donis Flagello, NRCA fellow, Nikon Research Corporation of America<br><br>This year, SEMICON West is integrating the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) sessions into the TechXPOT and Extreme Electronics platforms on Thursday, July 12. The Test Vision 2020 Conference will be held in conjunction with SEMICON West, on July 11-12. In addition, a special session on supply chain opportunities in 450mm wafers will be held on Thursday, July 12. Other TechXPOT sessions, yet to be announced, will address new materials, advances in 3D-IC, MEMS, test, advanced packaging, LEDs, OLEDs, and productivity solutions for 200mm and 300mm fabs.<br><br>For more information, including keynotes, programs, registration, and exhibiting, visit www.semiconwest.org.
