                    <p>
                    Aldec Europe announces Creonic GmbH has joined its UNITE Programme as an IP Partner.<br><br>This partnership is to provide interoperability to Creonic's IP with Aldec’s EDA tools such as Active-HDL, Riviera-PRO and ALINT. Creonic offer precompiled simulation models of its IP cores to improve simulation performance.<br><br>Dr. Matthias Alles, CEO and co-founder of Creonic, comments: “We use Aldec’s solutions to accelerate the development of our cutting-edge IP cores. For example, ALINT is used heavily for design rule checking and Riviera-PRO is our chosen platform for advanced verification. We’re also a keen advocate of the functional coverage capability within the Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OS-VVM™), with which Aldec has strong ties.”<br><br>Creonic offers ready-for-use IP cores for many communications algorithms and the company’s areas of expertise include Forward Error Correction (e.g. LDPC and Turbo coding) and synchronization, as well as MIMO and OFDM.<br><br>Christina Toole, Corporate Marketing Manager of Aldec Inc., states: “Long-term relationships are the cornerstone of Aldec’s success, and through our UNITE™ Programme we are working with many of the industry’s most well-known vendors of EDA solutions, IP developers and training companies to benefit our mutual customers.”<br><br>Alles concludes: “Through our use of Aldec’s EDA solutions and taking advantage of the OS-VVM we’re able to ensure our IP products comply with the highest requirements in terms of quality and performance. In addition, and a most welcome benefit, the UNITE™ programme has opened up new sales avenues for our IP offerings.”
