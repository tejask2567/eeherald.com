                    <p>
                    Synopsys, Inc. has completed the acquisition of EVE, a leading supplier of emulation platforms for SoC verification. Emulation is a quickly growing solution in the spectrum of technologies used to validate complex systems on chips (SoCs). EVE's technology integrating with Synopsys' platform of simulation, debug, verification IP (VIP), coverage, static verification, low power verification, FPGA prototyping and virtual prototyping solutions offers Synopsys customers access to the broadest verification offering. The terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed. Synopsys does not predict the transaction to have a material impact on its financial results in 2012 or 2013.<br><br>"Synopsys has long led in delivering high-performance verification solutions to address the verification challenges associated with the growing complexities in SoCs," said Manoj Gandhi, senior vice president and general manager of Synopsys' Verification Group. "By adding EVE's technology and engineering talent, Synopsys is expanding its investment in verification to continue to bring new technology innovations to our customers."<br><br>EVE provides emulation technology utilized by major semiconductor and electronic systems companies globally. EVE emulation systems offer a broad portfolio of transactors.<br><br>"The combination of Synopsys and EVE will allow us to deliver our emulation solution more broadly while integrating with Synopsys' best-in-class simulation, debug, VIP and prototyping solutions," said Luc Burgun, president and CEO of EVE. "I look forward to accelerating industry innovations in hardware-assisted verification as part of Synopsys."<br><br>EVE becomes part of the Synopsys verification business unit, with Mr. Burgun leading the emulation team.<br><br>Source: Synopsys
