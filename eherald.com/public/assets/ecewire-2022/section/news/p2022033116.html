                    Wind River is now ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified by A-LIGN. ISO 27001 mandates number of  controls for the establishment, maintenance and certification of an information security management system (ISMS). The Wind River says its ISMS is designed to cover all key areas of a robust information security program with a focus on providing secure product management and services for employees, customers and partners.<br><br>The risk of Global cybercrime as stated by Wind River:  Global cybercrime costs are expected to grow by 15 percent per year, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015.1. Wind River intend to meet increased security requirements through this ISO 27001 certification.<br><br>Wind River claims it has received the certification upon its first ISO attempt, showcasing the completeness and rigor of its information security program. To achieve the ISO 27001 certification, organizations must demonstrate a systematic and documented approach to protecting and managing sensitive company and customer information including intellectual property, employee and customer data, financial information and information entrusted to it by third parties.<br><br>“As a company delivering software to mission-critical industries where security is paramount, nothing is more important than protecting the assets and data of our customers, partners and employees,” said Rich Kellen, chief information security officer, Wind River. “Earning the most widely recognized information security certification is not only an industry differentiator, but also a significant accomplishment and testament to our ongoing and long-standing commitment to the highest level of security.” <br><br>The scope of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification covers the ISMS supporting Wind River’s people, processes, and technologies related to the provision of customer support and professional services, product management, and information technology services. As security requirements increase, Wind River rises to help customers overcome their cyber requirement challenges by obtaining security certifications such as ISO 27001, Cyber Essential Plus, NIST SP 800-171, and TISAX.
