                    Infonetics Research, a market research firm, has released an extract from its service provider deep packet inspection products report. This excerpt tracks the standalone DPI vendors and solutions for wireless and fixed line networks.<br><br>"Though fixed-line operators continue to invest in deep packet inspection solutions for traffic management and to manage the impact of over-the-top (OTT) content on their networks, wireless operators are looking to DPI for more granular traffic management, including prioritization and strategic offload, and are starting to deploy DPI hand-in-hand with their LTE network upgrades," notes Shira Levine, directing analyst for next gen OSS and policy at Infonetics Research.<br><br><br>DPI market highlights<br><br>1. Service provider deep packet inspection (DPI) product revenue grew 29% to over $470 million worldwide in 2011<br>2. Forecast of the service provider DPI market to grow to $2.0 billion in 2016, with the bulk of the growth coming from the mobile space<br>3. Huawei narrowly pulled ahead of Sandvine to take the lead in global service provider DPI revenue share in 2011<br>4. DPI is increasingly being incorporated into larger solutions, such as video optimization and mobile offload, creating opportunities for suppliers that offer DPI technology on an OEM basis<br>5. Operators are evaluating alternatives to throttling or blocking high-bandwidth video content, including using DPI for media caching, to prioritize select video content to support guaranteed QoS and as part of a content delivery network strategy<br>6. Infonetics expects strong growth for service provider DPI products in emerging markets in Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa as operators look to address network congestion caused by rapid subscriber growth, comply with regulatory requirements, and support cyber security initiatives<br><br>Vendors tracked by Infonetics are Allot, Arbor, Cisco, CloudShield, Huawei, Ipoque, Procera, Qosmos, Sandvine.<br>Regions tracked by Infonetics are North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and CALA (Caribbean and Latin America)
