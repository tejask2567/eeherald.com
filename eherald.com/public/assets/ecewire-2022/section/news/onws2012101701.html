                  <p class="title-text"> HP ProLiant Gen8 servers using AMD Opteron 6200 processors achieved highest Vmmark </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    AMD has said that a cluster of HP ProLiant BL465c Gen8 servers using AMD Opteron 6200 Series processors has achieved the highest VMmark 2.1 score ever posted, representing a 40 percent rise over the next best score. VMmark is VMware’s popular multi-server benchmarking tool that measures platform performance and scalability of virtualized environments. The record score of 59.99 at 62 tiles displaced a score of 42.79 at 36 tiles – a 40 percent increase in performance and a 72 percent increase in the number of virtual machines (VMs).<br><br>For the benchmark, HP used 16 HP ProLiant BL465c Gen8 blades, the highest volume selling blade in the world, each running two 16-core AMD Opteron 6278 processors yielding a total of 496 VMs with an average of 31 VMs per blade at a cost of $371 per virtual machine. HP BladeSystem, the Converged Infrastructure architected for any workload from client to cloud, provides the performance and scalability required to support an ideal virtualization platform for IT professionals who are moving to dense virtualization environments as a foundation for building both public and private clouds.<br><br>“The new VMware benchmark is a further indication that AMD Opteron processors are ideally suited for virtualization,” said Suresh Gopalakrishnan, corporate vice president and general manager of Servers, AMD. “Servers using high core-count AMD Opteron 6200 series processors provide outstanding performance, reliability, scalability and affordable efficiency for virtualized IT environments and cloud computing.”<br><br>AMD Opteron-based servers also provide superior price/performance while decreasing capital expense (capex) by up to 30 percent versus comparable solutions. These findings, based on earlier published VMmark 2.1 benchmarks of high-end systems, can amount to $130,000 in savings or more for a single server rack, allowing IT decision makers to reduce capex and total cost of ownership (TCO).<br><br>AMD is to showcase its virtualization solutions at VMworld 2012 through October 12 at Barcelona’s Fira Barcelona Gran Via, hall 7, level 0, stand G312.<br><br>Source: AMD
