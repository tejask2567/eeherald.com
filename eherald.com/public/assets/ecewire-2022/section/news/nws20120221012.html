Ember's ZigBee-certified Smart Energy Profile platform will be integrated into Ambient's dynamic, low-cost and consumer-friendly line of in-home, smart meter energy products.<br><br>"Ambient Devices and Ember share a long friendship dating back to our infancies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, where both were established," said Pritesh Gandhi, CEO of Ambient Devices. "Both companies are committed to leadership and excellence in developing products that empower consumers and the utilities that serve them to reduce energy costs and also help preserve the environment."<br><br>"Ember is thrilled to be working side-by-side again with Ambient Devices in this endeavor," said Bob LeFort, CEO of Ember. "Energy management is turning out to be a big piece of the Connected Home, and state-of-the-art products, such as those from Ambient Devices, will make it simple for average homeowners to impact how they monitor and control their energy consumption."
