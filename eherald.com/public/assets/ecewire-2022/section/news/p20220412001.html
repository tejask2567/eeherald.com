                  <p class="title-text"> The proponents of FDSOI to define new-gen roadmap </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    The inventors and promoters of Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator (FDSOI) CEA, Soitec, GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics are going for a new  collaboration to jointly define the industry’s next generation roadmap for FDSOI  technology. Claiming FDSOI as a beneficial technology offering significant advantages such as low-power consumption, and support easier integration of RF and security features. This Europe born technology is said to offer strategic value to France and the European Union and those who support this technology worldwide. FDSOI serves the needs of automotive, IoT and mobile application-specific system on chips which need to consume low power  and integrate analog, digital and RF functions in a single monolithic die at less expensive process.      <br><br>“CEA has been, for over 20 years, a pioneer of the FDSOI technology, within the Grenoble-Crolles ecosystem. CEA has also a long history of deep R&D cooperation with both STMicroelectronics, Soitec and GlobalFoundries and has been very active in the initiatives led by the European Commission and Member States aiming to set up a complete ecosystem for FDSOI going from material suppliers, design houses, EDA tools providers, fabless companies and end users”, said François Jacq, CEA Chairman. “CEA is highly motivated by this opportunity to prepare a new generation of FDSOI technology providing higher performance, lower power consumption and lower costs to address the needs of major European markets such as automotive, IoT, 5G/6G and manufacturing 4.0.”      <br><br>"FDSOI is a key technology for the dynamic markets we address and an important growth driver for our industry and our customers,” said Paul Boudre, CEO of Soitec. "The FDSOI alliance that we are pleased to announce today is built on Soitec’s capacity to drive innovation in substrates and help launch a new generation of semiconductors serving a large variety of markets including connectivity, automotive, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Together with our partners and allies, we want to confirm our technological leadership and continue to drive innovation in global microelectronics. This collaboration also illustrates how closely we work with our customers to advance technologies, address their future needs, and accompany them to go to market at a high pace.”     <br><br>“We look forward to deepening our partnership with the leading French and European stakeholders across the full semiconductor value chain and in particular to build on our highly differentiated FDSOI-based solutions together to address the rapid growth of chips requiring low power, connectivity, and security in automotive, IoT and smart mobile devices,” said Tom Caulfield, CEO of GlobalFoundries. “The dynamic European semiconductor ecosystem is important to us and we will continue to invest to grow our presence in the EU as part of our global growth strategy.”<br><br>“ST was an early innovator in FDSOI and has been in production for several years, with both custom and standard advanced products for a broad range of end-markets. In particular, the technology supports the automotive industry as it transitions to full digitalization and software-defined architectures in addition to the development of driverless technologies”, said Jean-Marc Chery, President and CEO of STMicroelectronics. “We look forward to working with other leading experts on the next generations of FDSOI that will enable our customers to overcome the challenges they face as they transition to full digitalization and support the decarbonization of the economy”.
