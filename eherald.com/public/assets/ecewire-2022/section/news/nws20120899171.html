                    Active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays are using on-cell touch, while TFT LCD makers are focusing on in-cell touch technology for high-resolution LTPS, according to DisplaySearch. In the case of the Samsung Galaxy S2 and S3, AMOLED technology is being coupled with on-cell touch, and Apple is expected to incorporate in-cell touch in combination with LTPS TFT LCD on the iPhone5, which is expected in 2H'12, says DisplaySearch.<br><br>NPD DisplaySearch forecasts a reduction in cost for the process of bonding touch panels with displays, eventually decreasing the cost of smart phones for consumers. NPD DisplaySearch also predicts smart phones developed with this combination technology will become thinner, as consumer demand for a more lightweight device continues to rise. In addition, NPD DisplaySearch predicts these smart phones will feature a higher brightness as the glass sheets used for the outer touch panel are removed.<br><br>DisplaySearch predicts touch panel combination technology is expected to provide a major revenue stream for small/medium FPD applications. In fact, by next year, the majority of panel shipments are expected to use touch panels combined with FPD, incorporating both in-cell and on-cell touch. This segment is forecast to grow to 70% by 2015.<br><br>Figure 1: Touch Panel Combination Shares in High Value FPD (2011-2016)<br>Smart Phone<br><br>Source: NPD DisplaySearch Advanced Quarterly Small/Medium Shipment and Forecast Report<br><br>“While this combined technology is expected to drive future demand, shipments are fairly stagnant because of a wait-and-see mentality that’s occurring in the marketplace at this time,” noted Hiroshi Hayase, NPD DisplaySearch Vice President of Small/Medium Display Research. “In Q2’12, NPD DisplaySearch found that shipments of small/medium displays have tapered off as both consumers and competitors wait for the release of the iPhone 5 in the second half of the year.”<br><br>In terms of expectations for the iPhone 5, DisplaySearch finds LTPS TFT LCD production to increase with new fabs added in 2H'12. AMOLED production is increasing in expectation of expanding sales of the competing Galaxy S3, adds DisplaySearch. Shipments of medium-sized LCDs in the 7“-class is also estimated to increase due to new tablet PC models launched later 2012.
