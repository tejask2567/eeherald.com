                    <p>
                    Newport Media has announced significant design wins at several of the leading suppliers of Smartphone and Feature phone cellular products.<br><br>The new models available in Latin America such as Motorola EX139, LG X350 (both dual SIM feature phones) and the Samsung Galaxy YTV S5357 Android Smartphone use System-on-Chips (SoCs) from Newport Media. In Japan, network operators have selected several Newport Media Digital TV enabled Android Smartphones including NTT DoCoMo’s SC-06D Galaxy III from Samsung, KDDI’s ISW13HT from HTC and Softbank’s 009Z from ZTE.<br><br>Newport Media's solutions address the market for Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) based Mobile TV handsets. Newport Media also offer ISDB-T products that integrate RF TV Tuner and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)/Analog demodulation into a single die. Several ISDB-T products from Newport Media include hardware based H.264 audio/video decoding functionality.<br><br>“Newport Media offers a comprehensive portfolio of embedded software solutions tailored for both the Japanese and Latin American ISDB-T markets,” said Mohy Abdelgany, president and chief executive officer for Newport Media. “These software solutions combined with wide variety of best in class SoC solutions from Newport Media have been a major contributing factor to our success with these new handsets being announced today, and are prime examples of the capabilities we bring to the table.”
