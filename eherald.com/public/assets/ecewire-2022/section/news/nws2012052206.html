                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    According to the Markinetics report (commissioned by Emerson Network Power), the ATCA equipment market reached an estimated size of $742.1 million in 2011, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately nine percent from 2010. By the end of 2012, the ATCA market is expected to grow further and slightly exceed $831 million. The Markinetics report states that Emerson Network Power captured 19.2 percent of the overall market and cites the company's strategic acquisitions and investment in ATCA research and development.<br><br>Richard Dean, senior vice president, Markinetics, Inc., said: "Achieving global competitive advantage in an ever-changing, intensely competitive, and highly-regulated industry requires much more than competent products, services, and favorable pricing. The ATCA supplier, then, can be most successful when it possesses unique technical resources and market development capabilities which enable it to profitably satisfy these customer needs in ways that are difficult to emulate. Maintaining a leadership position over an extended period generally requires a sensible blend of customer intimacy, operational excellence and technology leadership. Emerson Network Power is one of only a small handful of firms capable of demonstrating a comprehensive technical and services roadmap over time and is therefore more likely to become a preferred ATCA vendor of choice and expand its installed base."<br><br>"With over 25,000 ATCA systems and 200,000 blades deployed in carrier networks, it is clear that Emerson Network Power is the leader in ATCA," said Brian Brown, vice president and general manager, marketing and services for the Embedded computing business of Emerson Network Power.
