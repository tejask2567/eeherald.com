                    <p>
                    Marvell has announced an end-to-end cloud services and infrastructure platform that accelerates the connected lifestyle for businesses and consumers. Marvell offers networking, compute and storage solutions that support all three clouds - private, public, and home - as well as fiber and mobile Internet service infrastructure.<br><br>Marvell's approach to cloud services and infrastructure encompasses the following four elements:<br><br>Private cloud<br>A highly agile, mobile workforce needs access to corporate applications and data anytime, anywhere via various user platforms, requiring a more efficient and secure network.<br><br>The first end-to-end silicon solutions introduced at Interop, Marvell include:<br><br>1. 4x4 wireless access point technology with implicit beam forming for extended connectivity range for     clients.<br>2. Commercially available silicon for centralized traffic managed access solutions<br>3. The highest density, commercially available silicon solution for 40G datacenter interconnects<br><br>Public cloud<br>The public cloud is the backbone of the connected lifestyle, hosting a variety of social media and ecommerce services, enabling digital content such as pictures, books and videos to be easily stored and retrieved from anywhere in the world at anytime.<br><br>At Interop, Marvell is to demonstrate<br>1. A public cloud server/storage solution that leverage Marvell's ARM CPUs and storage controllers     along with a complete server software suite<br>2. A tiered cache with MIOPS, and the ARM base cold storage solution designed for an optimal balance     between disk capacity and power envelope<br><br>Home cloud<br>Today's homes are becoming increasingly digital with the introduction of devices like smart meters, wireless thermostats, and Internet-enabled TVs. The explosive growth of smart phones and tablets is driving the demand to access home content and systems 24/7 from anywhere. At Interop, Marvell is to introduce a home server solution that is low-cost, simple to use and provides easy remote access and offer:<br>1. A complete platform built with key technologies, including a low-power ARM CPU, SOHO switch,     power management and connectivity solutions ranging from 4x4 wireless, Zigbee to G.hn with MIMO     support<br>2. The SoC enabling a low power, always-on, home server that fosters a new generation of remote     cloud services including content access, smart energy management, health monitoring and     personalized entertainment<br><br>Infrastructure<br>Infrastructure is the foundation that connects all the clouds - private, public and home. The explosion of the mobile Internet, however, is challenging the efficiencies of the current infrastructure. Carriers are building out a new generation of WLAN, 3G and 4G/LTE-based networks, but it is critical that these new provider networks be reliable, secure, robust and able to scale. At Interop, Marvell is to introduce end-to-end platform solutions that enable service providers to maximize their network performance and generate new revenues. They include<br>1. Platforms for LTE "World Modem" and Universal PON (Avanta) access<br>2. True 100G line-rate programmable (Xelerated) packet processing for access, transport and     backhaul<br>3. Commercially available single-chip, terabit switch platform for carrier-grade ATCA, serving gateways     and UPON OLTs<br><br>Marvell's cloud services and infrastructure demos are available at Interop by appointment only.
