"We are creating a structure to provide better visibility into the important developments happening across the Zigbee Alliance, and our Europe Interest Group provides an efficient avenue for more two-way dialogue and information exchange between regions, countries, companies and individuals all working toward the same technology goals."<br><br>The release shared the below assigned tasks of the group:<br><br>Providing input to the Board regarding European technology needs and current events;<br>Collecting, capturing and sharing ongoing information about EU regulation and standards to the Working Groups within the Alliance to aid in the development of global, open IoT standards;<br>Sharing regular Project CHIP updates to EU member companies;<br>Facilitating discussions around Project CHIP interoperability across Europe while providing insight to shape future endeavors for the European landscape;<br>Coordinating and engaging with Alliance marketing teams to support EU events and speaker programs.<br><br>"The formation of this European-centric group will take Alliance-wide cooperation and communication to new levels, which is essential as our game-changing Project CHIP initiative comes into focus and to the market in early 2021, and we continue to drive openness and interoperability through our flagship Zigbee standards," said Bruno Vulcano, R&D Manager at Legrand and Chairman of the Board for the Zigbee Alliance."
