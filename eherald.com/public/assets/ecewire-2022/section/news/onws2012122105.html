                    <p>
                    In the year 2012, though global semiconductor revenue is estimated to fell by 3-4%. The technology is moving faster. The 28nm mode which was predicted as tough-to-get-yield has achieved great success. Starting with FPGAs from Xilinx and Altera and SoC chips from many fables vendors have shipped in volumes.<br>Some examples of 28nm products launched recently:<br>Cortina Systems has announced 28nm Electronic Dispersion Compensation (EDC) PHY architecture. The first member of this architecture is the CS4343 Octal 15G EDC device.<br>Broadcom Corporation has introduced the 28 nanometer (nm) XLP 200-Series, a new line of low-power multicore communications processor for applications such as enterprise, service provider 4G/LTE, data center, cloud computing and software defined networking (SDN) environments.<br>Broadcom Corporation has started sampling the NLA12000 Series, what it claims as the industry's first heterogeneous Knowledge-Based Processors (KBPs) manufactured in 28 nanometer (nm).<br>Avago Technologies has launched its new Vortex Gearbox family of Physical Layer Transceiver (PHY) devices supporting Ethernet and Optical Transport Networking (OTN) made using 28nm semiconductor chip fabrication node.<br><br>Next node 20nm is not successful both by option as well as production. Since FinFETs are used beyond 28nm and the investment required is high, industry may move directly to 14nm or in some cases 16nm. Test chips are already taped in 14nm node.<br><br>EDA vendors Synopsys and Cadence have announced successful tapeout of 14nm test chip. Cadence said it has taped-out the first 14-nanometer test chip implementation of ARM Cortex-A7 processor using Samsung fab.
