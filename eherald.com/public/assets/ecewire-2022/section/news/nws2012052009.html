                  <p class="title-text"> Kyocera phone uses LCD display as speaker </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Kyocera Corporation has released a new mobile phone called "URBANO PROGRESSO" with a Smart Sonic Receiver technology which transmits clear voice quality to the user directly through vibrations in the handset's LCD display screen by using advanced ceramic technology.<br><br>The smart sound receiver which replaces the traditional speaker uses a piezo-electric actuator to create vibrations along a wide area of the display screen which in turn transmits clear voice quality to the user. This is the first smartphone in the world to be equipped with this function.<br><br>Since the vibrations cover a wide area of the screen, the user is able to hear clear voice quality regardless of where their ear is placed. The outside noise can be muted by pressing the whole screen against your ear to create a cover, making it is easier to hear in crowded and noisy environments.<br><br>Another intersting feature of this phone is URBANO PROGRESSO is compatible with WiMAX high-speed Internet service with speeds of up to 40 Mbps (down) and 15.4 Mbps (up).
