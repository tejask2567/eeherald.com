                    <p>
                    To commemorate the 25 th anniversary of Toshiba's invention of NAND flash memory, it has come out with below NAND flash memory promotion campaign.<br><br>Video Series: This series of brief videos takes a humorous look at what life might be like without NAND flash. Visit www.flash25.toshiba.com/#watch for a first look at Toshiba's NAND Flash Deprivation Experiment: Evidence that life without flash technology would be a cruel experiment, indeed!<br>25 Years of NAND Flash website: A new website launched to be a one-stop shop for all things related to the 25 th anniversary of NAND flash. Visit www.flash25.toshiba.com to see each NAND Flash Deprivation Experiment video as they roll out throughout the year. The site also features a timeline of notable NAND flash achievements over the past 25 years, images, industry voices, and much more.<br>Facebook: Get involved - Like Toshiba's 25 th anniversary of NAND flash page on Facebook to join the conversation: www.facebook.com/Flash25Toshiba.<br>Twitter: Follow Toshiba on Twitter to stay up to date on all of the latest campaign happenings: @Flash25_Toshiba.<br>Giveaways: For U.S. residents, like www.facebook.com/Flash25Toshiba on Facebook and enter in the drawing to win one of five Toshiba Excite Tablets! Measuring just 0.35 inches thin and weighing a mere 1.32 pounds, the Excite 10 tablet is extremely portable. And thanks to the 16GB of flash memory on board, you'll be able to store large volumes of photos, books, videos, games, music, and other data. Additionally, each month, the first 100 people in the U.S. to like the Facebook page and enter to win will receive a free NAND Flash Deprivation Experiment t-shirt.<br><br>Greg Wong, Founder and Principal Analyst, Forward Insights quoted "NAND flash memory is the great enabler. Its form factor advantage over HDDs has enabled the era of portable digital storage - allowing consumers to carry their content with them anywhere - possible. Its performance advantage has facilitated the convergence of multiple functions - voice, e-mail, video, imaging, gaming, navigation - into one personal mobile device. And now, its cost advantage over DRAM is enabling the instantaneous accessing and sharing of content through the cloud."<br><br>Jeff Janukowicz, Research Director, IDC said "Over the last few years NAND has become the de facto standard for storage in many consumer devices. Now, NAND is on the cusp of making significant inroads into another market segment - the computing market. NAND technology is poised to change the PC experience and become a key building block for the enterprise."
