                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Invensas, subsidiary of Tessera Technologies, Inc. has unveiled its bond via array (BVA) technology for 3D semiconductor packaging. BVA is an ultra-high I/O packaging alternative to wide-I/O through silicon via (TSV) that delivers the performance required by mobile OEMs while preserving the proven infrastructure and business model of traditional package-on-package (PoP). Invensas' BVA technology enables high-performance consumer electronics to overcome the processing demands of next-generation designs without altering existing packaging infrastructure. This makes it an ideal low-cost and highly adoptable solution for mobile device manufacturers, explains Invensas.<br><br>BVA PoP is ideally suited for applications processor plus memory PoP stacks. By increasing processor to memory bandwidth, BVA PoP enables higher resolution, faster frame rate video streaming, faster search, higher resolution multi-screen, multi-application operation, more life-like gaming and a whole new generation of high-resolution 3D applications, claims Invensas.<br><br>"The challenge in today's mobile devices is that they all need to support high resolution screens, real-time downloads, high-definition, 3D and other advanced graphics processing capabilities that require an exponential increase in processor to memory bandwidth," stated Simon McElrea, president of Invensas. "BVA PoP technology is able to significantly increase bandwidth to enable advanced smartphone and tablet features that are unachievable with today's conventional technologies. With BVA we are bringing to market another cost effective solution to a critical industry problem by way of improved product performance and value."<br><br>The ultra-high I/O offered by BVA far exceeds what is possible with today's solder ball stacking and solder filled laser via approaches and permits intermediate increases in bandwidth in PoP, delaying the need for TSV, according to Invensas.<br><br>Other advantages explained by Invensas includes:<br>A copper wire bond-based package stacking interconnect technology, BVA PoP enables reduced pitch and a higher number of interconnects in the PoP perimeter stacking arrangement. It has demonstrated scalability to a 0.2mm pitch, leapfrogging the current capabilities of solder ball and solder via stacking to meet the industry's desired increase in bandwidth.<br><br>BVA PoP's alternative interconnect system is able to achieve wide I/O capability using common, low cost wire-bond technology. Because BVA PoP utilizes the existing package assembly and surface mount technology (SMT) infrastructure, it does not require a large capital investment and can be quickly adopted to provide increased bandwidth at low cost.<br><br>"With this new approach we're taking PoP from 240 pins to 1,200 pins. In doing so, BVA significantly pushes out the need for 3D-TSV. At the same time, it renders solder via obsolete as it is able to cost-effectively scale to ultra-high I/O," continued McElrea.<br><br>Invensas to present its BVA PoP solution at the Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC) at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina in San Diego. Titled "Fine Pitch Copper PoP for Mobile Applications" the paper will be part of Session 31, "Applications With 3D Technology," at 4:45 PM on Friday, June 1, 2012. Invensas will also exhibit at ECTC in booth 107 on May 30 and 31, 2012.
