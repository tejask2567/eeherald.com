                    The ultrabooks are designed to perform better in all aspects such as processing performance, user interface and mobility compared to thick notebooks. Similarly the All-in-one (AiO) PCs offer better value and aesthetics for the user compared to desktops with separate monitor and cpu box.<br><br>Market researchers are forecasting fairly good to very good growth for both All-in-one computers and ultrabooks.<br><br>IHS iSuppli has forecasted unit shipment of AiO PCs to reach 16.4 million in 2012, up a robust 20 percent from 13.7 million units last year. In comparison, worldwide growth of traditional desktop PC shipments in 2012 will amount to a dismal 0.2 percent—rising from approximately 132.0 million units to 132.3 million units.<br><br>“The AiO PC is especially appealing to consumers that have been waiting for a desktop-monitor combo that not only combines the strengths of a traditional desktop system but also offers a few more extras typical of the new versatile devices, such as a flexible form factor, a large screen size and touchscreen optical technology,” said Craig Stice, senior principal analyst for compute platforms at IHS.<br><br>Apple was No. 1 last year in AiO shipments, with 28 percent share of the market, followed by Lenovo, Dell, HP and Sony. The largest original development manufacturer for Aio PCs was Quanta Computer of Taiwan, whose clients include Apple, Lenovo and HP, as per IHS iSuppli. Pegatron and Wistron are said to be important manufacturers of the machines.<br><br>On the forecast for ultrabooks, Merrill Lynch had forecasted global sales of Ultrabooks would total 15 million units in 2012 and 50 million units in 2013. Another market analyst DRAMeXchange has reported in Nov 201 regular notebook is expected to grow by over 10% and its shipment volume is estimated to increase from 173.4M in 2011 to 194.6M in 2012. On the other hand, compromised by the rising popularity of tablet PC, netbook’s shipment volume is expected to fall from 22.4M in 2011 to 18.6M in 2012, representing a 17% decrease. Netbook’s weak performance placed a dent in the growth momentum of notebooks, and notebook’s YoY shipment growth rate has reached a plateau, declining from 20% over the past few years to 5-10%.<br><br>Windows 8 is expected to change the market dynamics further due to its seamless working in AiC, Ultrabook, tablet and smart-phone.
