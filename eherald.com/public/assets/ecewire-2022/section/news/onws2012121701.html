                    The companies who have car parking sheds in the premises of factories and any such large offices can turn their open-space car shelters into solar electric plants which in turn can charge electric cars of employees. Kyocera has said it has supplied photovoltaic (PV) solar panels to power the new 90-kilowatt canopy that charges electric vehicles (EVs) at the world-famous San Diego Zoo.<br><br>Solar PV panels fitted on the roof harness the sun's energy to charge EVs in the Zoo's parking lot and provide renewable energy to the electrical grid, while its high-tech battery system stores solar power for future use. Ten solar canopies, designed and installed by Vista-based Independent Energy Solutions (IES), produce 90 kilowatts (kW) of peak generating capacity – enough to power 59 homes – as well as five EV charging stations, including one in a nearby ADA-accessible parking space. Using new lithium-polymer battery technology, its 100-kW energy storage system is charged by the solar canopies to offset demand on the electrical grid and recharge EVs after sunset. When the battery is full, excess energy generated from sunlight is put into the grid to improve reliability and benefit the surrounding community. The solar canopies also provide shade to approximately 50 cars in the Zoo's southeast parking area.<br><br>"Kyocera is celebrating 41 years in San Diego, and 37 years as a leader in solar energy solutions," said Steve Hill, president of Kyocera Solar, Inc. "We're proud to work with other San Diego companies that are equally committed to making sustainable energy a reality, especially at one of the most well-known landmarks in the country."<br><br>"Independent Energy Solutions is honored to have served Smart Cities as the design/build contractor on this Solar-to-EV project," said Linda Strand, president and CEO of Independent Energy Solutions. "This project showcases how energy storage, electric vehicle charging and solar energy can be successfully integrated, providing benefits to the public while remaining environmentally sound."<br><br>“This high-profile and innovative collaborative project combines two major sustainability initiatives – solar energy and electric vehicles – showcasing to the millions of Zoo visitors that the future of energy is in San Diego today," said Jim Waring, executive chair of CleanTECH San Diego and Smart City San Diego partner. "Kyocera is a recognized solar industry leader and its commitment to quality and local manufacturing is important to Smart City San Diego's mission as well."
