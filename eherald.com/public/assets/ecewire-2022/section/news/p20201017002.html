                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                     With the onset of 5G deployments, lot of microwave and satellite systems operating in C band spectrum will see increased interferences from 5G operating in these frequency bands.  To mitigate the effects of 5G on such communication systems, RF component maker Dow-Key Microwave announced a new variety of C-band SATCOM solutions. <br><br>The company has shared some of the recent happenings in this direction where it said "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sealed the fate of satellite operators in the C-band spectrum to expand flexible use of the spectrum for 5G deployment, requiring satellite operators to clear the spectrum. The Commission voted to sell the licenses to the spectrum in a public auction, which will begin on Dec. 8 of this year. Within the 3.7-4.2 GHz band, the FCC is allocating the 3.7-4.0 GHz portion of the band for mobile use, and 280 megahertz from 3.7-3.98 GHz band will be auctioned by the FCC for wireless services in the contiguous United States. Commissioners expect the auction to generate tens of billions of dollars."<br><br>"Microwave Products Group, a Dover company which consists of Dow-Key Microwave, BSC Filters, K&L Microwave, and Pole/Zero provides various solutions to mitigate your 5G interference.   We specialize in high-performance RF and microwave waveguide, filters, and switches.  We also have extensive experience in custom retrofit solutions and a strong heritage in defense, space, and aerospace." stated in its release.<br><br>A brief explanation on waveguides from the company: Waveguide RF switches are electromagnetic switches with hollow circular or rectangular cross-sections and are used for routing RF energy in microwave communications, broadcasting, and in radar applications. Waveguide switches can be used to transfer both power and communication signals, and the bandwidth of a waveguide is in relation to its size, and thus always referred to by its size (e.g. WR112, WR90, WR75 etc.). Compared to coaxial RF switches, waveguides can route extremely high power signals over a narrow bandwidth at low to high frequencies, and now Lightweight Waveguide series is available.
