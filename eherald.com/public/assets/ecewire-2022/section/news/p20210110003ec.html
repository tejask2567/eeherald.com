                  <p class="title-text">  MaxLinear WAV664 is selected by Wi-Fi Alliance as Wi-Fi 6E test bed device </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Wi-Fi Alliance has selected MaxLinear' WAV664 as an official Wi-Fi 6E test bed device. MaxLinear says its the second MaxLinear device to hold such an honor, the Home Wi-Fi Chipset WAV600 Series is part of the Wi-Fi Alliance Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 test bed.<br> <br>"The WAV664 delivers speeds up to 4.8Gbps in the 6GHz band enabling routers and gateways to deliver multi-gigabit Wi-Fi speeds and provide higher-quality user experiences for applications in Ultra HD, 4k and 8k video streaming especially in dense environments.  In addition, the WAV664 SoC supports up to 256 clients simultaneously and optimizes transmission on each device for enhanced total network efficiency allowing access points to meet the accelerating demand for high bandwidth and low latency." stated in the release from MaxLinear. <br><br>Wi-Fi Alliance says its certification for Wi-Fi 6E is now available to deliver interoperability for devices operating in the 6 GHz spectrum. Interoperability certification for Wi-Fi 6E – as part of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 – is introduced as global momentum for Wi-Fi operation in the 6 GHz band increases daily. Wi-Fi 6E brings the immense benefits of 6 GHz spectrum to consumers, device manufacturers, and service providers as the band is being made available around the world. Wi-Fi Alliance certification helps ensure users receive a secure, reliable, and interoperable experience with Wi-Fi 6E devices.  <br><br>The 6GHz band adds 1.2GHz of spectrum, a threefold increase in capacity over combined spectrum available in 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.  It enables support of up to seven contiguous 160MHz channels for bandwidth-intensive applications. Wi-Fi 6E enables better user experience with reduced latency for gaming, video conferencing and time sensitive applications while improving the aggregate network performance.<br> <br>“As the unencumbered 6GHz spectrum becomes available, MaxLinear is proud to be an ecosystem enabler of this new Wi-Fi technology,” said Doron Tal, General Manager of Broadband Access at MaxLinear. “As part of the WAV600 series of products, the WAV664 is the next advanced building block that enables the full potential of high data rates and low latency our customers need to extend their solutions into new applications.”<br> <br>“People demand matching capabilities of their Wi-Fi as they do from new 10Gbps access technologies like 5G and 10G DOCSIS 4.0,” said German Laryczower, Senior Vice President, Broadband Home Solutions, CommScope. “With the use of 7x160MHz Wi-Fi 6E channels of multi gigabit, low latency capacity now available to the home, we can build new ultra-immersive and lowest latency services on the Wi-Fi 6E platform. These platforms will accelerate adoption of AR/VR services.”<br> <br>“Wi-Fi 6E certified devices help promote rapid adoption and innovation in 6GHz,” said Kevin Robinson, SVP of Marketing, Wi-Fi Alliance. “As one of our interoperability test bed devices for Wi-Fi 6E certification, MaxLinear is playing an important role in ensuring users are delivered a secure and interoperable experience with Wi-Fi 6E products.”
