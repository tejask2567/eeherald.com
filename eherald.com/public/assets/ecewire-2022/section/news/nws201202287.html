                    In-Stat research forecasts that nearly 23 million wireless HD video-enabled devices will ship in 2015.<br><br>"While all three technologies will see some type of market adoption over the forecast period, WiGig is likely to be the most popular wireless HD video technology," says Brian O'Rourke, Research Director. "The specification has support from a wide range of technology companies, including silicon vendors, CE device makers, mobile phone vendors, and software companies. In addition, WiGig will be the 60GHz Wi-Fi specification, called 802.11ad."<br><br>The report includes the following findings:<br>Desktops, standard notebooks, and netbooks are unlikely to adopt the technology over the length of the forecast period, primarily because of the cost.<br>WiGig/802.11ad is likely to be big in mobile PC docking solutions, and WirelessHD and WHDI are focusing more on CE-based solutions.<br>DTV is the most important market in CE, as wireless mobile PC-to-DTV connections are a key use case for wireless HD videoThe WiGig Alliance has many WLAN silicon vendors among its members, as well as a diverse assortment of major technology companies, including Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Samsung, Nokia, and Broadcom.
