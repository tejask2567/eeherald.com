                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Wind River has announced support, training and services for the development of applications based on the Intel Data Plane Development Kit (Intel DPDK). These offerings are immediately available to customers developing on any Linux operating system to help them create cost-effective, high-performance networking solutions based on the latest Intel processors.<br><br>Wind River Linux is currently fully integrated with Intel DPDK for built-in high-performance optimizations for fast packet processing. The combination of Intel multi-core platforms and the Intel DPDK, a set of data plane libraries designed for high-speed networking, can achieve high levels of packet processing.<br><br>"Communications equipment makers are under pressure to create devices that can handle the strain of today's data intensive networks. Intel DPDK delivers strong packet processing capabilities from Intel-based processors," said Glenn Seiler, senior director of product management at Wind River. "When customers combine the fast packet delivery of Intel DPDK with protocols such as IPsec and applications like deep packet inspection (DPI), they can create high performance solutions for a broad set of network elements, security appliances, mobile and broadband edge devices. Companies can now take advantage of Wind River's expertise with Intel DPDK whether they are developing on Wind River Linux or any Linux distribution of their choice."<br><br>"We reported up to a 30% performance boost when our Sensory Networks HyperScan DPI software was used with Intel DPDK integrated with Wind River Linux, compared to the same tests without Intel DPDK, said Sab Gosal, chief executive officer for Sensory Networks. "With Wind River Linux optimized for Intel DPDK and multi-core Intel architecture, our HyperScan software delivers wire-speed DPI while providing greater network security and inspection intelligence. This integrated solution creates a compelling proposition for network equipment suppliers looking to build out their DPI functionality with ease and a rapid time to market."<br><br>"The Intel Data Plane Development Kit is able to deliver new levels of packet processing performance," said Stephen Price, director of marketing, communications infrastructure division at Intel. "Wind River offers complete lifecycle solutions such as development, support, services and integration for the Intel DPDK which helps customers consolidate workloads and enable high performance packet processing on Intel architecture."<br><br>More information is available at http://www.windriver.com/announces/intel-data-plane-development-kit/
