                    <p>
                    Cypress Semiconductor Corp. has announced that Traxxas, one of the leading providers of ready-to-run (RTR) radio controlled hobby vehicles, has selected Cypress’s WirelessUSB-LP 2.4-GHz radio-on-a chip for their new XO-1 radio controlled supercar.<br><br>The XO-1 RTR car is capable of going from 0 to 100 MPH in just 4.9 seconds. It won the 2012 Readers’ Choice Award for the Best Electric On-Road Car and the Best Innovation from RC Car Action Magazine. It employs the TQi, a 2.4-GHz high-output radio system with a two-channel transmitter, a five-channel receiver and an internal antenna. It also offers a dock for use with Apple iPhone and iPod touch that enables live telemetry data and easy control customization. More information about the XO-1 is available at www.traxxas.com.<br><br>“We pride ourselves in bringing the best quality radio controlled hobby vehicles to the market”, said Braulio Parajon, Director of Marketing at Traxxas, “Long range, superior co-location with minimal chances of cross-talk, and low latency with uncompromising quality were ‘must-haves’ for the XO-1 supercar. Cypress provided a robust, flexible solution with the WirelessUSB-LP radio that not only met all of our stringent design specifications but also helped us accelerate our time to market”<br><br>“We’re excited to help bring the world’s fastest RTR supercar to market,” said Jayant Somani, Senior Director, Marketing for Cypress’ Data Communication Division, “This product is an outstanding showcase for the market leading features of Cypress WirelessUSB solutions built for the remote controlled toys and hobby vehicle markets.”
