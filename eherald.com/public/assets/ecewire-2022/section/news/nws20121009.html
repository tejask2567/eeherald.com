                  <p class="title-text"> Xilinx acquires Modesat Communications to strengthen wireless backhaul solutions </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Xilinx, Inc. has declared the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Modesat Communications. With this acquisition, the OEMs focusing on mobile backhaul platforms can now gain the market competitiveness and differentiation. Xilinx wireless mobile backhaul solutions offer quicker time-to-market and viable alternatives for OEMs, who are inhibited today by limited merchant IP options. Customers can retain their proprietary IP while leveraging the backhaul solutions.<br><br>“Xilinx is excited to acquire Modesat and merge their products and technology with our existing wireless solutions to better serve our valued customers. We have consistently received feedback from our customers to provide total solutions optimized for wireless mobile backhaul applications. We’ve listened to our customers and aligned our portfolio and roadmap to serve their needs. Modesat is a great synergistic fit,” said Krishna Rangasayee, senior vice president and general manager of the Xilinx Communications Business Unit. “This is another affirmation of our commitment to the wireless markets and to offer our customers the best combination of silicon, solutions IP and design services to assist them in differentiating and succeeding in their markets.”<br><br>“Xilinx is the industry's leading FPGA manufacturer for the wireless communications market. Bringing our modem technology and design expertise to the Xilinx family is an ideal fit,” said Tarmo Pihl, co-founder of Modesat Communications. “Xilinx currently does significant business in the wireless infrastructure backhaul segment based on their complete All Programmable FPGA offering. With the addition of Modesat backhaul solutions the opportunity in this segment will be greatly expanded and we will be better able to serve tier-1 and tier-2 wireless infrastructure customers and provide complete backhaul modem solutions.”<br><br>Modesat IP solutions are optimized algorithmic implementations designed from the ground up targeting FPGA silicon. Modesat’s patented technology has been validated by customers and designed into multiple customer backhaul systems. Their IP solutions cover the complete wireless mobile backhaul requirements for wireless single-carrier PHY, packet processing and connectivity (eNet) capabilities.<br><br>Targeting Xilinx All Programmable FPGAs and Zynq-7000 System-on-Chips (SoCs) with Modesat’s IP cores and the existing Xilinx signal processing and packet processing IP cores, customers are to get the advantages of high system performance, low power consumption, flexibility of All Programmable system integration, BOM reduction and accelerated design productivity. Xilinx wireless mobile backhaul solutions offer a viable alternative to rigid ASSP-based merchant silicon solutions in the market today.<br><br>Modesat Communications was founded in 2005 in Tallinn, Estonia and concentrates in the development of backhaul modem solutions for microwave, E-band and NLOS (non-line of sight) markets. The company has fifteen employees, who are to join Xilinx as part of the Xilinx Communications Business Unit. Modesat offices in Tallinn and San Diego, California are to continue operations.<br><br>“The main characteristics of the mobile backhaul equipment market have changed little in the last year with certainly IP/Ethernet being the primary driver. Mobile operators and backhaul transport providers are investing heavily in IP, which in turn is helping push the equipment market in total,” stated Michael Howard, principal analyst for carrier networks at Infonetics Research. “The move to IP as the basic technology of LTE (and WiMAX) is growing no matter how it is measured. Microwave backhaul is a very attractive market, and microwave is the dominant backhaul solution already at $4B in 2012, growing to over $5B in 2016.”<br><br>Source: Xilinx
