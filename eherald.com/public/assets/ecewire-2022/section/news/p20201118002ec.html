                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Lattice Semiconductor has formed a focused group called Lattice Design Group (LDG) to help its customers to speed up their FPGA based designs. LDG to share its expertise with Lattice customers in differentiating products with unique value addition.  LDG to give access to its application-specific solutions stacks, and embedded software development.<br> <br>The stacks include:<br>    Lattice sensAI for Edge AI applications<br>    Lattice mVision for embedded vision applications<br>    Lattice Sentry for hardware security applications compliant with NIST Platform Firmware Resiliency (PFR) Guidelines (NIST SP-800-193)<br><br>The expertise spans trending applications such as  artificial intelligence (AI), embedded vision, and hardware security for the communications, computing, industrial, automotive, and consumer markets.<br><br>Bob O’Donnell, President and Chief Analyst at TECHnalysis Research, said, “In an increasingly competitive global electronics market, OEMs face intense pressure not only to get new products to market first, but also with support for the right applications. For customers facing a tight design schedule or looking for a unique application to give their product a competitive advantage, organizations like the LDG provide a welcome extension to their own design resources and capabilities.”<br><br>“Developing low power solutions for applications like AI at the Edge requires a unique mix of expertise including machine learning algorithms, low power optimization techniques, and hardware/software co-design. With an award-winning portfolio of low power FPGAs and application specific solutions stacks, Lattice is ideally positioned to help our customers create differentiated solutions,” said Deepak Boppana, Sr. Director, Segments and Solutions Marketing, Lattice. “We’re excited to offer the LDG’s services to accelerate time-to-market for our customers, including non-FPGA designers looking for best-in-class solutions for their applications.”<br><br>LDG team members to work closely with its customers team members  at every stage of the product development from concept to final testing. LDG to help its customers to pick the right low power Lattice FPGA for their application.
