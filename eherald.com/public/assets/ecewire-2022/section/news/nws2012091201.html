                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    The IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) has adopted four USB-IF specifications.Those include the Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0) specification, USB Cables & Connectors specification v2.0, USB Battery Charging specification v1.2, and Micro-USB Cables and Connectors specification v1.01.<br><br>The four above-mentioned USB-IF specifications have been included in the newly approved IEC International Standard IEC 62680, Universal Serial Bus interfaces for data and power. The Standard has been developed by IEC TC (Technical Committee) 100: Audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment, TA (Technical Area) 14, and has now been formally accepted by IEC Member states through their National Committees. The agreement between IEC and USB-IF allows for the adoption of additional USB specifications into IEC International Standards in the future.<br><br>“IEC has worked with the USB-IF to give consumers worldwide standard solutions for data and charging applications. We believe that the broad adoption of USB specifications will enhance IEC International Standards for a wide range of applications,” says Ronnie Amit, General Secretary and CEO of the IEC.<br><br>“This collaboration benefits manufacturers and consumers by broadening global support and recognition of these specifications,” explains Mr. Shuichi Matsumura, Technical Area Manager of TA 14 and Senior Expert, Standards Strategy Office at Fujitsu Limited. TA 14 was the first IEC Technical Area to include USB specifications into an IEC International Standard.<br><br>“Worldwide recognition from IEC helps further advance USB-IF’s world-wide position in data transfer and charging,” said Jeff Ravencraft, President & COO, USB-IF. “In addition to current joint efforts, IEC and USB-IF will continue to collaborate to promote the adoption of USB specifications within the IEC.”
