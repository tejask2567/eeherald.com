                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Infonetics Research has released the following two excerpts from its first quarter 2012 (1Q12) vendor market share and forecast reports.<br>1. Wireless LAN equipment and WiFi phones<br>2. Ethernet switches<br><br>"Sales of wireless LAN and Ethernet switching gear declined sequentially in the first quarter of 2012, mostly due to a typical seasonal buying lull, but also due to weakness in the EMEA region," explains Matthias Machowinski, directing analyst for enterprise networks and video at Infonetics Research. "Despite the sequential lull, on a year-over-year basis, WLAN market growth remains strong, up in the double digits for the 10th straight quarter."<br><br>Machowinski adds: "Wireless LAN is the more exciting part of the enterprise networking market, but a number of interesting things are happening on the wired side as well, including tremendous revenue growth in the 10G Ethernet switch segment, where port shipments doubled year-over-year and revenue is set to hit the $10-billion mark next year, as well as rapid adoption of the latest technology arrival, 40G Ethernet, which has already exceeded expectations."<br><br>Wireless LAN market highlights:<br>1. In 1Q12, due to seasonal buying trends, the global wireless LAN equipment revenue dipped 4%     from the previous quarter to $859 million.<br>2. Access point (AP) shipments have more than doubled over the last 5 years, and over 3/4 of all units     are based on 802.11n technology<br>3. #1 player Cisco increased its market share in 1Q12, as did #2 player Aruba, while Motorola edged     ahead of HP by a hair and Ruckus maintained its 5th position<br>4. In 1Q12, Vocera, Polycom, and Cisco continued their tight battle for the lead in the single-mode WiFi     phone market, all within several revenue market-share points of each other<br><br>Infonetics' quarterly Wireless LAN equipment and WiFi phones report tracks Aerohive, Alcatel-Lucent, Aruba, BelAir, Brocade, Cisco, D-Link, Enterasys, Extreme, Juniper, Meru, Motorola, NETGEAR, Polycom, HP, Ruckus, SMC, Xirrus, and others. The report provides market size, market share, analysis, and forecasts for interactive, independent, and outdoor access points (including AP forecasts by technology: 802.11 a/b/g, 802.11n, 802.11ac), WLAN controllers, and enterprise single-mode WiFi phones.<br><br>Ethernet switch market highlights:<br>1. Global Ethernet switch revenue totaled $4.7 billion in 1Q12, down 9% from the previous quarter, but      up by double-digit percentages from the year-ago 1st quarter<br>2. Revenue and port growth was well balanced as vendors continued to successfully sell higher-priced     products (such as data center switches) and faster ports<br>3. Following a 31% spike the previous quarter, 10G Ethernet port shipments declined 1% in 1Q12;     quarterly shipments are still double that of a year ago, benefitting from data center upgrades, 10G      server adoption, server virtualization, and core network buildouts<br>4. 40G Ethernet sales jumped 50% in 1Q12 from 4Q11, driven by dedicated 40G fixed switches      (16xQSFP+)<br>5. After HP acquired 3Com, Cisco lost Ethernet switch revenue market share 4 quarters in a row, but     Cisco is back to posting market share gains, albeit modest, on a year-over-year basis<br>6. North American Ethernet switch revenue is down 11% sequentially due to seasonal trends, but      growth jumped 14% from the year-ago 1st quarter<br><br>Infonetics' quarterly Ethernet Switch report tracks Adtran, Alcatel-Lucent, Alaxala, Arista, Avaya, Brocade, Cisco, D-Link, Dell, Enterasys, Extreme, Hitachi-Cable, HP, Huawei, IBM, Juniper, NETGEAR, LG-Ericsson, and others. The report provides market size, market share, forecasts, and analysis for fixed configuration Ethernet switches (unmanaged, Web-managed, and Layer 2 and Layer 3 managed switches) and chassis Ethernet switches by port type (10/100M, 1G, 10G, 40G, and 100G).
