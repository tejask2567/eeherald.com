                    <p>
                    The 23rd annual SEMI advanced semiconductor manufacturing conference (ASMC 2012) will be held on May 15-17 in Saratoga Springs, New York.<br><br>ASMC provides a venue for industry professionals to learn and share knowledge on new and "best practice" semiconductor manufacturing issues and concepts.<br><br>This conference focuses on issues faced by the semiconductor manufacturing. There will be 85+ manuscripts covering critical process technologies and fab productivity presented in this conference.<br><br>A panel discussion on "Competing for R&D dollars: funding the future" is offered by ASMC to discuss on the issues and funding on limited R&D dollars, wafer size transition, next node scaling, new transistor technology, 450mm EUV and 3D-IC. Panelists are from Applied Materials, ASML, Global foundries and IBM.<br><br>15 technical sessions on advanced semiconductor manufacturing, and a tutorial on advanced device design by IBM research are also part of this event.<br><br>There shall be keynotes delivered by:<br>Michael Campbell, senior vice president, engineering, Qualcomm<br>Andrea Lati, principal analyst, VLSI research<br><br>ASMC 2012 sessions include:<br>1. 'Factory optimization' session to discuss novel solutions to improve equipment and factory productivity and performance.<br>2. 'Advanced metrology' session details new technologies and improvements.<br>3. '3D/through silicon via (TSV)' session presents complexities of TSV techniques supporting 3D designs.<br>4. 'Equipment, materials & processes' session to discuss about the innovations to meet the challenges of advanced memory and logic manufacturers.<br>5. 'Emerging technologies and innovative devices' session presents analysis of the effects of enabling technologies, and innovative integrated circuit designs.<br>6. 'Equipment and materials productivity' session on how to help optimize equipment utilization, improve predictive modeling of fab operations, and tool performance.<br>7. 'Advanced patterning and design for manufacturability' session to collaborate efforts on leading-edge solutions between chip makers and equipment suppliers.<br>8. 'Process development and control' session covers improvements in processes, tool controls and predictive process performance analysis.<br>9. 'Defect inspection and yield optimization' session to cover defect inspection, yield analysis and optimization in the development and manufacture of semiconductor devices.<br><br>Registration for ASMC 2012 is available at www.semi.org/ASMC
