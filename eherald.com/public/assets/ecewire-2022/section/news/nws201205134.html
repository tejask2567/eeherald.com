                    AMD has announced that its AMD Embedded G-Series platform now supports Windows Embedded Compact 7 real time operating system. Windows Embedded Compact 7, paired with AMD Embedded G-Series accelerated processing units (APU) delivers feature rich applications on small, specialized devices for industries such as medical, retail and industrial automation. This enables board, module and system OEMs to develop a wide range of applications requiring high performance and integrated graphics processing with minimal size, power and cooling constraints.<br><br>"AMD is committed to providing our customers with the broadest possible range of operating system support to help them bring devices to market quickly and cost effectively," said Buddy Broeker, director, AMD Embedded solutions. "Seamless support for Windows Embedded Compact 7 helps ensure that AMD Embedded G-Series customers are equipped to take full advantage of the many benefits afforded via the combination of these leading technologies."<br><br>With the combination of AMD Radeon graphics and the "Bobcat" x86 core, AMD Embedded G-Series APUs can provide superior performance-per-watt ratios.<br><br>"We are excited AMD has expanded G-Series APU support for Windows Embedded Compact 7, giving OEMs the resources to drive innovation in a wide range of specialized devices," said Steven Bridgeland, product manager for Windows Embedded at Microsoft. "These advances will help device manufacturers best leverage the Windows Embedded Compact platform to build industry-leading technologies that power intelligent systems."<br><br>Features available with Windows Embedded Compact 7 include Silverlight for Windows Embedded and multi-touch support optimized for intuitive, natural input capabilities and gesture based interactions.<br><br>Available boards and modules supporting AMD Embedded G-Series APUs and Windows Embedded Compact 7 include the MSM-eO/-N PC/104-Plus SBC from Kontron, the CAPA111 3.5" SBC from Axiomtek and others.
