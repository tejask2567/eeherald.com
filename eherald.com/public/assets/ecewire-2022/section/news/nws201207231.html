                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Wi-Fi Alliance said it has recently initiated a task group to build upon its popular certification for Wi-Fi Direct. The effort is aimed at developing a Wi-Fi Direct Services platform to foster development of applications and drive an enhanced user experience with a range of common tasks.<br><br>The work will augment the existing Wi-Fi Direct certification, and will be backward compatible with already available Wi-Fi Direct devices. Launch of the new enhancements is targeted for 2013.<br><br>“Our members have embraced Wi-Fi Direct as an important solution to connect devices directly, which creates an opportunity now to do more,” said Kelly Davis-Felner, Wi-Fi Alliance marketing director. “Building on Wi-Fi Direct to enable multi-vendor interoperable applications will continue to drive the technology’s adoption.”<br><br>Wi-Fi Direct has been widely adopted, with more than 1,100 certifications completed since the program’s launch in October 2010. The list of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Direct products includes a range of televisions, mobile phones, printers, PCs and tablets, as well as silicon from all major Wi-Fi chipset vendors. Market research firm In-Stat predicts that nearly all PCs, mobile devices, and portable consumer electronics will support the technology behind Wi-Fi Direct by 2014.
