                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Japan based Toshiba to develop hydrogen fuel cells generating 100s of Kilowatts of power in  a compact and lightweight modules. This was announced after Toshiba Energy has signed an agreement with New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) on commissioned business for a multi-utility pure hydrogen fuel cell module for large modes of transports.<br><br>The planned high-power 200kW class standard module of pure hydrogen fuel cells is designed for use by vessels, railroad vehicles, construction machinery and other large modes of transport. It is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2024.<br><br>Toshiba said it is employing technologies from its stationary pure hydrogen fuel cell power generation systems to develop a high-power pure hydrogen fuel cell module for large modes of transport which offers greater durability and is more compact.<br><br>The module is also being designed for better response, consideration for environmental effects such as vibration, and for safety according to safety codes and standards.<br><br>Toshiba ESS has already been developing pure hydrogen fuel cell systems for large modes of transport, including a 30kW mobile pure hydrogen fuel cell system2 developed and supplied for field verification testing in 2019, and began work on a demonstration3 for the commercialization of vessels equipped with high-power fuel cells in September 2020. <br><br>Yoshihisa Sanagi, General Manager of the Hydrogen Energy Business Div. at Toshiba ESS, said, "We are dedicated to developing pure hydrogen fuel cell systems for modes of transport, expanding hydrogen usage, and facilitating hydrogen energy implementation."
