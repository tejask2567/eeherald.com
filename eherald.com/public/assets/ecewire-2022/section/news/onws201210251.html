                  <p class="title-text"> Mindspeed's Comcerto processor selected by Genexis for its CPE products </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. has announced that Genexis has selected Mindspeed's Comcerto family of multi-core ARM based communications processors to develop a line of broadband CPE products that support new protocols and higher speeds with lower power consumption.<br><br>"We are very excited to be working with Mindspeed's Comcerto processors on our new line of broadband gateways," said Tom Andersen, director of product line management with Genexis. "Mindspeed's new processors build on previous experience with Comcerto devices that have proven to work well in earlier Genexis products. The Comcerto devices are fast and well integrated and they enable us to offer industry-leading features and the next generation of software-defined networking solutions."<br><br>"Genexis has quickly become one of the leading suppliers of home gateways to the fiber-to-the-home market, worldwide, and we are committed to helping them broaden their success by providing the advanced processing foundation for one of their new product lines," said Marco E. Bello, executive director of marketing and product management for the communications convergence processing (CCP) business unit at Mindspeed. "Our Comcerto family gives Genexis and its customers the confidence of a carrier-hardened processing platform that delivers an unprecedented combination of feature integration, performance and power efficiency at the industry's lowest price level."<br><br>The recently announced Comcerto 2000 communications processors utilize patented wire-rate, gigabit-speed Open Packet Acceleration Logic (OPAL) data-path acceleration technology to deliver high performance. This consists of fully-programmable wire-speed network accelerators for IPv4/IPv6 and six packet forwarding/network address translation (NAT), firewall/VPN, IPSec/SSL security processing, deep packet inspection (DPI), quality of service (QoS) and storage network processing. The offload permits the two 1.2GHz ARM Cortex-A9 processors to be fully available for executing value-added applications from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or service providers.<br><br>The Comcerto 2000 processors function either as control and management processors or as integrated control and data path processors. They can be utilized in a variety of secure systems, such as security gateways or converged broadband home router (BHR) and set-top box (STB) media gateways that need digital rights management (DRM) support. The devices are backward-compatible with the broad range of carrier-proven software that has developed for Comcerto 100 and 1000 communications processors. These processors also feature a comprehensive set of I/O and peripherals, as well as support for DDR3 with ECC.<br><br>"Mindspeed's Comcerto 100 and 1000 processors have won numerous designs in broadband gateways," said Joseph Byrne, senior analyst at The Linley Group. "The latest Comcerto 2000 processor has capabilities that no other single processor can match, and Mindspeed has the opportunity to leverage this advantage to replicate its success in gateways, compete for next-generation solutions used in 10G-EPON and 2.5Gbps GPON deployments, and address the broader communications market as well."<br><br>Source: Mindspeed
