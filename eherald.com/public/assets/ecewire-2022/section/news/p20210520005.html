                    <p>
                    STMicroelectronics to acquire AI software company Cartesiam, which is specializes in artificial intelligence (AI) development tools enabling machine-learning and inferencing on Arm-based microcontrollers.<br><br>Cartesiam has a team of data scientists and embedded signal processing experts. Cartesiam's NanoEdge AI Studio lets embedded systems designers without prior knowledge in AI to quickly develop specialized libraries integrating machine-learning algorithms directly into range of applications including connected devices, household appliances, and industrial machines.<br><br>ST says NanoEdge AI Studio solution is fully complements  its STM32Cube AI toolset and will provide STMicroelectronics’ customers with additional flexibility to integrate machine-learning into their solution.<br><br>“Using artificial intelligence to create ever smarter solutions is one of the priorities of our customers regardless of their size or industry,” said Claude Dardanne, President, Microcontrollers and Digital Ics Group, at STMicroelectronics. “With STM32Cube.AI, STMicroelectronics already offers the ability to map and run pre-trained artificial neural networks on our broad portfolio of STM32 microcontrollers. The addition of Cartesiam’s machine learning technology to STMicroelectronics’ existing solutions will provide the best edge-AI solution portfolio on the market for any customer looking to bring additional innovation to their offering.”
