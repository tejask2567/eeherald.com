                    <p>
                    STMicroelectronics has integrated remote control technology from RealVNC onto ST's automotive grade infotainment application processors. The integration will simplify and accelerate the roll out of mobile-to-vehicle connectivity solutions, supporting the seamless and safe interplay of phones, apps and cars.<br><br>Smartphone-centric in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems are the next step in mobile convenience; they allow the car to access the contents of the portable device and display the data and apps on the in-dash head unit. For example, drivers can pipe Google Maps or smartphone navigation apps onto the car's display screen and control the applications from there. Similarly, they can use the larger display to manage what they are listening to without fumbling with their mobile device while driving.<br><br>When integrated into the application processor, VNC automotive enables automatic detection, screen replication and control of virtually any mobile device from a vehicle's touch-screen or fixed-input controls such as steering-wheel switches and head-unit buttons. With RealVNC's remote-control capabilities pre-integrated onto ST's processors, head-unit and infotainment system, manufacturers can fast-track time-to-market for smartphone-centric in-vehicle infotainment systems.<br><br>ST's infotainment application processors can provide a vehicle-occupant's smartphone with GNSS positioning signals from the in-dash system, enabling more accurate navigation capabilities and extending phone battery life.<br><br>"Seamless interaction between the phone and the car reduces driver distraction and increases cruising convenience making available the most relevant applications for in-vehicle use, including calling, navigation, and listening to music, through the in-car display," said Fabrice Guerrier, product manager, Navigation & Infotainment at STMicroelectronics. "Adding RealVNC's automotive interface to ST's automotive application processors increases the choice for car infotainment makers and shortcuts the path to building high-performance and flexible smartphone-centric in-vehicle systems."<br><br>VNC automotive provides full cross-platform remote access and control of mobile devices from IVI systems. The technology also enables many additional features, greater performance and robust, production ready availability on the widest range of mobile handsets.
