                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cavium, Inc. has announced its support for the new Wi-Fi Alliance wireless display specification, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Miracast. The list of wireless display and streaming protocols available on Cavium's PureVu CNW6611L media system-on-chip, including WiVu and DLNA supports Miracast standard. Cavium is also collaborating with Intel to offer Intel WiDi based products.<br><br>The Miracast standard enables media content to be transmitted over a Wi-Fi connection, directly from a media source device (notebook, smartphone, etc) to a sink device for a better viewing experience, without the need for a Wi-Fi access point.<br><br>Through the use of the latest Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA2) security mechanisms, the Miracast specifications contain strong security provisions as well as HDCP content protection for safe delivery of premium content. The underlying Wi-Fi technology allows for a direct, peer-to-peer wireless connection commonly referred to in the industry as Wi-Fi Direct.<br><br>"We're excited to see the progress by Wi-Fi Alliance towards the launch of the Miracast certification program," said Kourosh Amiri, Sr. director of marketing at Cavium's digital home and office division. "As the industry rallies behind the new standard, Cavium's multi-protocol universal adapter solutions are ideally suited to help drive the adoption of wireless display technologies and the growth of this market."<br><br>Cavium, Inc has also announced collaboration with Qualcomm to offer a mobile adapter solution based on the Wi-Fi Display standard "Miracast" and optimized to provide enhanced peer-to-peer connections with Qualcomm's Snapdragon platform.<br><br>The smartphone and tablet OEMs, as a result of the collaboration, would have access to a standards-plus wireless display reference solution capable of video transmissions with simultaneous, full interactivity achieved through optimized video compression and transmission latency. Both the companies are to provide solutions designed to support Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Miracast.
