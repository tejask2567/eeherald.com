                    <p>
                    MathWorks has announced that Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka, India has implemented a campus-wide license for the MATLAB and Simulink product families. With this implementation, Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT) has standardized on the tools for technical computing, simulation and model-based design. MIT's students will gain hands-on, practical experience with software, and MIT's faculty can engage is research and devise curriculum based on their experiences with these tools.<br>MIT has been using MATLAB and Simulink in its B. Tech and M. Tech courses since 2003 and has integrated the software into its curriculum. With the new campus-wide implementation, more than 2000 undergraduate and post-graduate students, and over 500 faculty members will be able to learn, teach and research with MATLAB and Simulink in MIT's labs, classrooms, and on laptops and PCs off-campus. The implementation will cover disciplines such as engineering, biological and life sciences, mathematics, physical sciences, and business and economics.<br>"Manipal Institute of Technology aims to train world-class engineers tuned to the demands of a fast-changing global economy. The campus-wide implementation of MATLAB and Simulink is a major stride towards arming our students with the relevant engineering knowledge and the skills to ably compete with the best in the global job market," said Dr. Vinod Thomas, associate director (Development), Manipal Institute of Technology. "The campus-wide license also ensures access to world-class research infrastructure for our faculty members."<br>"Engineering education needs to be in sync with the requirements of the industry. Globally, MathWorks has a strong focus on bridging the gap between the academia and industry sectors. By providing easy and campus-wide access to industry-standard software such as MATLAB and Simulink, MIT is equipping its students with a blend of theory and real-world technology practices, making them industry-ready," said Kishore Rao, managing director of MathWorks India.<br><br>About MathWorks campus-wide license<br>A MathWorks campus-wide license, also called the Total Academic Headcount (TAH) license, provides all students and professors of the academic institution or university, ready access to the latest versions of MathWorks software. In addition to the core products of MATLAB and Simulink, institutions can choose products that cover a variety of application areas, including image processing, control systems, statistics, finance, signal processing, mathematics, instrument control and data acquisition, and computational biology. The campus-wide license can be administered centrally and reduces administrative and technical costs of managing licenses within academic departments.<br><br>For more information about MathWorks in academia, visit www.mathworks.in/academia.
