                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Test and measurement equipment maker Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) has acquired SwissQual, a wireless networks test expert. Through the acquisition of SwissQual, founded in 2000 and based in Zuchwil, Switzerland.<br><br>The acquisition contract for the SwissQual company group was signed on June 22, 2012. Effective July 2, 2012, SwissQual will be a fully independent Rohde & Schwarz subsidiary. The company headquarters and regional presences will be retained. It will be referred to as "SwissQual AG – A Rohde & Schwarz Company" in external communications.<br><br>R&S says the product portfolios of both companies ideally complement each other: Rohde & Schwarz, with its expertise in RF test equipment, is well positioned in the network optimization and network engineering segments. SwissQual, the market leader for benchmarking systems, contributes solutions for network benchmarking and network monitoring. The product portfolio will offer a full range of solutions for QoS testing, end-to-end testing, drive test systems, scanners and wireless network optimization, stated in the release.<br><br>Dietmar Vahldiek, Director of the Systems and Projects Subdivision at Rohde & Schwarz, says: "SwissQual will significantly increase the Rohde & Schwarz market share in the drive test segment. Together, we have excellent customer contacts, and we will of course take advantage of the synergies in R&D, marketing and sales. We are very much looking forward to the closer cooperation." The two companies already have a sales partnership for the R&S ROMES2GO smartphone-based test mobile phones that were developed by SwissQual.<br><br>After years of substantial investment and rapid growth, the SwissQual shareholders were seeking a strong partner who would support continued growth. "I am very pleased that SwissQual is now part of the Rohde & Schwarz group of companies," says John May, CEO of SwissQual AG. "Our company cultures are a perfect fit. Both companies are known for their precise, superior development services and high-quality products. The acquisition provides an excellent platform for the company’s future."<br><br>SwissQual is said to be one of the largest independent suppliers of solutions for quality of service (QoS) benchmarking and RF optimization of wireless networks. The company is a recognized expert in the assessment of voice, data and video quality in wireless networks.
