                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    NXP Semiconductors N.V. has introduced a new family of automotive power MOSFETs based on NXP's Trench 6 technology, featuring extremely low RDSon, high switching performance, and better quality and reliability. Fully AEC-Q101 qualified, NXP's new automotive-grade MOSFETs have completed extended lifetime testing at 175°C for more than 1,600 hours - significantly exceeding Q101 requirements - as well as offering extremely low PPM levels.<br><br>The first products in NXP's new automotive MOSFET family will be available in D2PAK, at voltage grades of 30V, 40V, 60V, 80V and 100V, with good RDSon performance across the range. Future Trench 6 releases will be made in all other automotive packages.<br><br>Trench 6 further enhances switching performance compared to previous generations of TrenchMOS, enabling very low QGD for a given RDSon, which is suitable for DC-DC switching applications in the car.<br><br>"With our Trench 6 automotive power MOSFETs, we're offering an optimized, high-reliability solution for virtually every MOSFET socket in the car," said Ian Kennedy, product marketing manager, NXP Semiconductors. "Through extensive testing, we've demonstrated that Trench 6 - with its simple, evolutionary architecture and proven track record in the standard MOSFETs market over the past two years - can deliver the quality and reliability required to last the lifetime of the car."
