                    <p>
                    Market research firm Infonetics Research released excerpts from its new Worldwide Web Security SaaS Provider Scorecard, which analyzes and ranks the top web security-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.<br><br>Other highlights shared by Infonetics:<br>Cisco earned a high overall score of 57 out of 60 in Infonetics’ annual web security SaaS provider scorecard<br>zScaler leapfrogged McAfee and Symantec this year to move into 2nd place, in large part due to a strong and growing subscriber base and improvements in the strength of its security profile<br>McAfee and Symantec remain neck-and-neck, tied for 3rd and just 1 point behind zScaler; both companies face the long-term challenge of transitioning from security client software to cloud-based services<br><br>"Thanks to its good security profile, great brand presence, and strong product offering, Cisco tops our worldwide scorecard for web security SaaS for the second year in a row," announced Jeff Wilson, principal analyst for security at Infonetics Research. "But competition in this space remains fierce, with zScaler, McAfee, and Symantec in a virtual dead heat for the number-two spot, and newcomers Blue Coat and Barracuda positioned to make waves. With very little standing between first and last place in our vendor matrix, we expect this jostling to continue for the foreseeable future."
