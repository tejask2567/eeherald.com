                    NPD DisplaySearch forecasts AMOLED capturing 6% of the small/medium display market in 2012 and is forecasted to more than double by 2015 to 13%. Total OLED display shipments are expected to reach 191 million in 2012, accounting for an 8.4% share of the overall small/medium display category.<br><br>“Prior to the start of mass production of AMOLED displays for mobile phones, only passive matrix OLED (PMOLED) displays were available, mostly used in applications such as mobile phone sub-displays, automobile displays, and some industrial and niche applications,” said Yoonsung Chung, Director, Large-Area Displays & FPD Materials for NPD DisplaySearch. “AMOLED displays have driven total OLED penetration into the small/medium display market since 2010 when Samsung launched the Galaxy S, the first AMOLED smartphone in 2010.”<br><br>Figure 1: OLED Penetration in Small and Medium Display Shipments<br>display<br><br>Source: NPD DisplaySearch Quarterly Small/Medium Shipment and Forecast Report<br><br>NPD finds mobile phones continue to drive the growth of the OLED market, and mobile phone applications are expected to have a 69% share of the total small/ medium OLED market in 2012, growing to 83% in 2015. However, mass adoption of AMOLED technology will need to overcome some very real hurdles. AMOLED display technology is more expensive to produce and also takes time to gain expertise.<br><br>Figure 2: Small/Medium OLED Display Shipments by Application<br>display<br><br>Source: NPD DisplaySearch Quarterly Small/Medium Shipment and Forecast Report<br><br>“Samsung Displays produces nearly all AMOLED displays, but more players will need to participate in order to drive growth of AMOLED technology,” said Chung. “NPD DisplaySearch forecasts that new panel makers will enter the market in 2013, particularly from Taiwan and China. In addition, we expect to see OLED applications for smartphones, amusement devices, digital still cameras, and home appliances drive additional demand.”
