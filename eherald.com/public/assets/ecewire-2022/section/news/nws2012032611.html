                  <p class="title-text"> CHANGHONG selected Entropic's c.LINK IC for its EoC access equipment </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Entropic Communications, Inc. has collaborated with CHANGHONG in bringing out Ethernet-over-Coax (EoC) access equipment using Entropic's c.LINK Broadband Access IC to offer television, broadband and new IP-based video services to MDUs on the existing coaxial cable.<br><br>Entropic says CHANGHONG specifically selected Entropic's c.LINK Broadband Access solution based on its field-proven MoCA (Multimedia over Coax) silicon and cost-competitiveness. Further, the c.LINK solution is considered an advanced technology for the China EoC market, as it is a high Radio Frequency (RF) implementation-making it ideal for Multiple System Operators (MSOs) who are interested in a more robust system that can easily overcome bandwidth challenges related to interference and latency by providing superior performance, as per Entropic.<br><br>"In the FTTB environment, Entropic's c.LINK solution has better advantages and is an ideal fit for future demand on multi-services in the broadcasting industry. We look forward to continuing to build our relationship to develop new products for meeting the demands of the China market," said Mr. Jia HuiDong, vice general manager, CHANGHONG. "By leveraging Entropic's c.LINK solution, we gain a high RF implementation, offering greater service robustness and guaranteed throughput, as compared to other access technologies. Additionally, the high RF capabilities enable co-existence with legacy DOCSIS-based or video services residing on the coax - which was a core requirement for us."<br><br>"Our solution in combination with CHANGHONG's product allows for broadband service to be delivered to China MDU's where only a cable broadband infrastructure exists. Based on CHANGHONG's strong research and development capabilities and marketing strengths, we believe that the cooperation with CHANGHONG will be in broad areas and create win-win for both companies," said Tom Luan, vice president and general manager, China operations, Entropic Communications. "We are committed to enabling excellence in the high RF EoC market, and will continue to evolve and enhance our c.LINK platform to continuously meet the growing bandwidth demands put on MSOs networks."
