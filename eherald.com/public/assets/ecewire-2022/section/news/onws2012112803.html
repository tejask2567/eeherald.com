                    3-axis geomagnetic sensor made jointly by ST Microelectronics and PNI is used in Nintendo’s newly launched Wii U.<br><br>“The collaboration of advanced sensing technology and extensive know-how in gaming motion-control from ST, who is leading the MEMS market, and impressive geomagnetic-sensing technology from PNI, has strongly supported Nintendo’s challenge to deliver an entirely new kind of gaming and entertainment experience for consumers around the world,” said Genyo Takeda, Senior Managing Director, Nintendo Co., Ltd.<br><br>“Since its launch, the Wii has revolutionized the gaming world and ST has kept its close relationship with Nintendo by reliably delivering advanced MEMS technology while expanding its expertise in sensors for gaming, its manufacturing capability and its advanced MEMS technologies,” said Benedetto Vigna, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Analog, MEMS & Sensors Group of STMicroelectronics. “We’re pleased that PNI and ST can play an important role in the development of Nintendo's latest game console, the Wii U, and will continue to explore avenues that allow ST to demonstrate the value of MEMS.”<br><br>"We are pleased to have Nintendo, a true pioneer in interactive entertainment, select our geomagnetic sensor for use in the Wii U. And working closely with ST has made this possible" said Becky Oh, PNI Sensor President and CEO. “Our goals are to offer our sensors to customers who need to sense motion despite some magnetic interference, to complement their algorithms, and to react in real time."<br> <br>          	<br>ADVT<br>Home | News | New Products | India Specific | Design Guide | Sourcing database | Student Section | About us | Contact us | What's New<br>©2012 Electronics Engineering Herald
