                  <p class="title-text"> Synopsys and Applied collaborate on TCAD models for 14nm and 11nm chip design </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Synopsys, Inc. and Applied Materials, Inc. are collaborating to develop technology computer-aided design (TCAD) models to speed up process development for 14-nanometer (nm) and 11-nm logic and new memory semiconductor chip technologies.<br><br>The collaboration encompasses front-end-of-line (FEOL) processing, including process, topography and device simulation, and back-end-of-line (BEOL) reliability, including interconnect simulation. Previously, the two companies worked together on Silicon Germanium (SiGe) source/drain stressors where Synopsys TCAD models were calibrated with epitaxial films grown in an Applied Materials system. The companies have also collaborated on calibrating multiple ion implant schemes and through-silicon via (TSV) development.<br><br>"We have a long and successful history of working with Synopsys on TCAD process modeling that has resulted in faster qualification of our manufacturing systems by customers for new applications," said Dr. Klaus Schuegraf, vice president and CTO of the Silicon Systems Group at Applied Materials. "As new materials and designs make their way into leading-edge technology nodes, this new collaboration will enable our customers to take advantage of TCAD modeling to more rapidly develop and characterize new processes on our systems, saving them costly development time."<br><br>"TCAD modeling has been essential for the development of 3D FinFET and memory technologies," said Howard Ko, senior vice president and general manager of the Silicon Engineering Group at Synopsys. "The combination of Applied Materials' equipment and Synopsys' TCAD software will enable process engineers to continue scaling logic and memory devices. This collaboration combines the strengths of both companies and will provide leading-edge semiconductor companies tools to tackle the challenges and reduce the cost of technology development."
