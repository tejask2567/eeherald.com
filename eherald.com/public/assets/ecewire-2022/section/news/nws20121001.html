                    <p>
                    Cavium, Inc. has announced that NETGEAR’s recently released 3rd generation Push2TV wireless display adapter is based on Cavium’s CNW6611L media System-on-Chip (SoC) delivering wireless media connectivity. The new NETGEAR Push2TV wireless display adapter supports Intel Wireless Display (WiDi), and is pre-standard compliant with the Wi-Fi Alliance’s Miracast specification. NETGEAR’s new adapter leverages Cavium’s USB powered, low latency Tiga reference design to provide seamless connectivity to a wide range of notebook PCs, smartphones and tablets.<br><br>NETGEAR’s Push2TV wireless display adapters have been shipping in the market since the initial release of Intel WiDi solution in 2010. With over 30 million Intel WiDi-based laptops shipped to date, and the rising demand for Miracast functionality on smartphones, tablets, and notebooks, NETGEAR’s Push2TV adapter is extensively increasing the number of connected consumer electronics devices it can wirelessly receive media content from.<br><br>“NETGEAR has led the wireless display adapter market in the past 3 years with our 1st and 2nd generation WiDi-compatible Push2TV products,” said David Henry, vice president of marketing in the retail business unit at NETGEAR. “With Cavium’s flexible SoC and optimized reference platform, we are able to extend our price-performance market leadership with a new USB-powered design that is smaller, offers more features, yet priced more competitively than previous generations.”<br><br>NETGEAR’s Push2TV adapter uses Cavium’s CNW6611L media processor to provide better video quality, optimized end-to-end latency, and robust content delivery over standard WiFi. CNW6611L’s architecture provides the flexibility of a 1080p multi-format media subsystem, along with the raw horsepower of hardware accelerated security and graphics processing, to implement various wireless display capabilities with support for HDCP content protection.<br><br>“We are pleased to have been selected by NETGEAR for their 3rd generation Push2TV wireless display adapter,” said Raj Singh, General Manager of Cavium’s Digital Home and Office division. “Cavium’s state-of-the-art low power, low cost Tiga reference design offers unique differentiating features in quality and latency, which enables NETGEAR to continue its market leadership with its latest generation wireless display adapter design.”<br><br>Source: Cavium
