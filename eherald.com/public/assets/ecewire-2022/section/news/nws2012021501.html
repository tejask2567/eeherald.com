                    <p>
                    The immediate opportunity now in smart phones and tablet devices is customizing the device for different users. At recently concluded India Semiconductor Association's Vision Summit 2012 event, Sanjay Gupta, Senior VP of Wipro Technologies was explaining how they are designing different smart-phone user interface for office user, elderly person, students etc. It looks the screen-size-needs and also the applications-needs are different for an each set of users, if not for an every individual.<br><br>The screen size of tablet PC is an important factor in success of some the models such as Samsung Note which serves both as tablet and smart phone. How can the tablet leader Apple keep quiet when its strength lies in providing well-appreciated and most of the times industry's first impressive user interface, the news today is Apple testing different screen sizes including 8 Inch for its new version of tablets.<br><br>The question here is how to optimize the design? Because cost of the device matters. And also there is confusion of one device or two device per person. Whoever understands the user requirements has huge advantage over the competitors.<br>Some observation on this subject from own and other sources include:<br><br>Small screen size offers cost advantage and can be pocketed, but the larger screen always comfortable for reading and watching media content.<br><br>Different physical size of humans, the content usage, easy mobility, price range all matters seriously and providing customizing opportunity.<br><br>The researcher WitsView had earlier suggested that 9.7-inch and 10.1-inch products will still be the mainstream with around 85% of market share in the coming few years due to customers' preference of Tablet PC with large view. On the other hand, 7-inch Tablet PC could become a product with long-term sales potential due to its unique cost advantage and size segmentation.<br><br>WitsView had predicted that the shipment ratio of Tablet PCs of 7-inch and smaller sizes will climb to 10.4% in 2012 and 12.3% in 2013 from the 8.3% in this year. WitsView also said as long as the cost advantage of 7-inch product allows its end sales price to maintain around $100 USD gap with the mainstream 9.7-inch and 10.1-inch products, we can be optimistic about the follow-up development of product of this size.
