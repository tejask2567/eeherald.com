                    Research In Motion and its subsidiary, QNX Software Systems have announced a new initiative to encourage university students in China to develop more apps and services on the BlackBerry platform.<br><br>RIM and QNX are working with a number of universities in China to launch an app development competition at the end of May, providing further incentive for student software developers in the country to turn their creative ideas into apps and services that can be commercialized on BlackBerry smartphones and BlackBerry PlayBook tablets.<br><br>The initiative aims to nurture the spirit of innovation among young Chinese developers and provide a means for students to gain technology know-how and expertise in taking an idea from concept to market. The competition will focus on two categories: "Mobility lifestyle use" and "Automotive experience".<br><br>RIM and QNX will provide BlackBerry devices, software development tools, technical support and other resources. RIM has also been working with universities in China to provide training courses for developing apps on the BlackBerry platform.<br><br>"We are pleased to expand our work with universities in China to provide students with more opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge in the exciting and rapidly growing fields of mobile computing and automotive infotainment," said Urpo Karjalainen, regional managing director, Asia Pacific, Research In Motion.<br><br>The winning apps will be made available on BlackBerry App World and winners of the competition will have the opportunity to participate in internship programmes at leading Chinese and multinational companies.
