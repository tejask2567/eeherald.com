                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    BittWare has announced support for Altera's SDK for OpenCL on the S5-PCIe-HQ (S5PH-Q) board. The S5PH-Q is a half-length PCIe Gen3 x8 card based on Altera's high-performance 28-nm Stratix V FPGAs. Future releases of Altera's SDK for OpenCL will support the S5PH-Q as a platform for OpenCL development and demonstration. The S5PH-Q is the first board in BittWare's S5 family of products designed to support Altera's SDK for OpenCL.<br><br>"The S5PH-Q board features a flexible and versatile architecture, which, when coupled with OpenCL, dramatically simplifies FPGA development by enabling designers to code their systems and algorithms in a high-level C-based framework," stated Ron Huizen, BittWare Vice President of Technology. "This gives developers access to the latest generation of high-performance FPGAs on a validated COTS PCI Express board, while also providing them the opportunity to significantly reduce their time-to-market by making use of OpenCL kernels to target Altera FPGAs."<br><br>BittWare's press release comes on the heels of Altera's OpenCL announcement today: "Altera Announces Industry's First FPGA Support for OpenCL - Eases the Adoption of FPGAs for Accelerating Heterogeneous Systems".<br><br>S5-PCIe-HQ Overview<br><br>High-performance Stratix V GX/GS FPGA<br>PCIe x8 interface supporting Gen1, Gen2, or Gen3<br>Dual QSFP+ cages for 40GigE or 10GigE direct to the FPGA for lowest possible latency<br>Anemone floating point co-processor (optional)<br>Up to 16 GBytes DDR3 SDRAM<br>Up to 72 MBytes QDRII/II+<br>Two SATA connectors<br>Timestamping support<br>Utility I/O includes: USB 2.0, RS-232, and JTAG<br>Supported by BittWare's ATLANTiS FrameWork which provides seamless routing of all on-board data, I/O, and memory; and by BittWare's BittWorks software tools which include host interface libraries, a variety of diagnostic utilities & configuration tools, debug tools, and I/O drivers.<br><br>S5-PCIe-HQ Availability: Now
