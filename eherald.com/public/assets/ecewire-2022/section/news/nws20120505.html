                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    3M has announced a joint agreement with Nordson to provide a total assembly solution to consumer electronics customers. According to 3M, the joint agreement with Nordson helps round out the company's comprehensive offering of electronics bonding solutions, which includes pressure sensitive tapes that can be die cut to virtually any form and shape to meet the applications and responsiveness requirements for their customers.<br><br>Nordson Corporation will provide their Unity series robotic hot melt systems to handle and dispense 3M's plastic bonding adhesives for manufacturing smartphones, tablets and computers.<br><br>"Creation of this 3M and Nordson agreement reinforces our ongoing commitment to the mobile device and consumer electronics market," says John Schnarr, director, strategic marketing at Nordson. "Collaboration between our two companies will help us more rapidly identify and address growth opportunities and market shifts that our customers will face. In such a fast-paced and dynamic market, every minute, if not every second, can be critical to ongoing business success."<br><br>Nordson Unity dispensing systems provide accurate dispensing and optimize efficiency of heated materials from 30 cc syringes, and are suited to dispense heated polyurethane adhesives. Unity dispensers help extend the useful life of the syringe to maximize material use and minimize residual waste.<br><br>Plastic bonding adhesives from 3M create strong bonds between parts and are easy to use for fast assembly. These adhesives are for consumer electronic assembly applications, which require thin bond lines and narrow bond widths. These adhesives unique characteristic enables easy part disassembly to facilitate rework, repair and recyclability. Manufacturers can thus fix damaged parts, salvage expensive device components, and reduce their amount of electronic waste, keeping costs down all throughout the product lifecycle.<br><br>"We are committed to providing the best quality products and services to our electronics customers," said Tony DeRose, business unit manager at 3M. "Offering them a total assembly solution that utilizes Nordson expertise in equipment design and fabrication, plus 3M expertise in liquid adhesives, is part of that commitment. We are excited to formalize our relationship with Nordson to help ensure our customers' processes and expectations are met for their consumer device assembly challenges."
