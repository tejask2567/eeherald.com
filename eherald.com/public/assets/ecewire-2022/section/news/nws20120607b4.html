                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cosmic Circuits has announced that its MIPI M-PHY HS-G2 reference cards have been used by Agilent Technologies for the development of their MIPI transmitter measurement solution. The test solution is designed to perform MIPI M-PHY measurements automatically, saving time for the end-user.<br><br>"We are delighted to use the Cosmic Circuits' M-PHY for the development of our MIPI transmitter measurement solution," said Roland Scherzinger, Agilent's MIPI program manager. "Collaboration between early adopters of M-PHY is essential for providing robust solutions even before the new standard and its testing specification are mature."<br><br>The Director of IP of Cosmic Circuits, Sundararajan Krishnan, commented that "We are very excited to engage with Agilent on this development and are happy that this effort has seen fruition in the form of the MIPI M-PHY test suite. Our MIPI D-PHY and M-PHY solutions are getting integrated into the SoCs of leading fabless companies around the world and given our strong roadmap that extends into the very advanced process nodes, we expect to see even more adoption. Application boards with our test-chip are available upon request to customers"
