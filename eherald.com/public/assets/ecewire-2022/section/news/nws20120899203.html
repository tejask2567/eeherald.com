                    The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reports progress in extending Hydrogen fuel-cell powered electric vehicle driving ranges and increasing fuel cell durability. NREL finds this after executing a demonstration project.<br><br>"The project results show that fuel cell electric vehicles have advanced rapidly," said Keith Wipke, acting manager of NREL's Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies Program and the report's lead author. "As vehicle manufacturers and other researchers worldwide continue to focus on the remaining challenges of balancing durability, cost, and high-volume manufacturability, there is optimism that manufacturers will introduce FCEVs to the market within the next few years."<br><br>The Learning Demonstration project involving NREL started in 2004 with four major vehicle manufacturers (GM, Daimler, Hyundai-Kia, and Ford) and three energy partners (Shell, BP, and Chevron) contributing data for NREL analysis. Project costs were shared 50-50 between industry and EERE. Later, DOE's California Hydrogen Infrastructure Project, executed by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., contributed data on its fueling stations.<br><br>"We received final project data from our industry partners in October 2011, and have completed our analysis across the entire demonstration period," Wipke said. "Through this project, 183 fuel cell electric vehicles were deployed, 25 project fueling stations were placed in use, and no fundamental safety issues were identified."
