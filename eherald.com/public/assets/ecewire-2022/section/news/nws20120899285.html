                    <p>
                    Qualcomm Incorporated has acquired Israel based small-cell base-station expert DesignArt Networks. DesignArt’s technology also offers integrated line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight wireless backhaul to reduce the cost of outdoor small cell deployments.<br><br>“DesignArt and its products will both enhance and accelerate our initiatives to drive increased capacity and coverage in mobile networks,” said Craig Barratt, president of Qualcomm Atheros. “Operators can significantly improve user experience across residential, enterprise and outdoor networks given the greater network efficiencies derived by implementing small cells and heterogeneous networks.”<br><br>With this acquisition, Qualcomm says it adds the DesignArt LTE and backhaul solutions to its existing portfolio of small cell base station technologies and complementary Wi-Fi, Ethernet and passive optical networking (PON) connectivity solutions.<br><br>Small cell includes what is also called as pico cell and femto cell base stations.
