                    If you look into various sub segments of the semiconductor industry, memory is the one which sees high ups and downs. but the memories growth and fall is driven by  scaling of some of the computing and communication technologies. During PC market boom new advanced processors and latest operating systems demand larger capacities of DRAM and SRAM, due to which semiconductor memory market grew during the PC market growth. Nearly same thing repeated with smart phone market but it was also NAND Flash memory along with the DRAM and SRAM.  The fall of memory market due to negative growth of smart phone market can also be expected to follow the same pattern as the PC market dependent memory market behaviour.  In the first quarter of 2019, semiconductor sales fell to $114.7 Billion,  a 15.5% lesser compared to previous quarter indicating  year 2019 will not be a good year for semiconductor market where it is expected to see some negative overall growth in revenue.<br><br>If smart phones is one of the factor to drive the market back to growth, leading smartphone makers need to come out with some high-value innovation to boost its sales, even if that happens , that growth will be reflected on the semiconductor market in end of 2019 or later.<br><br>But for the semiconductor market, lot more new opportunities are emerging other than the PC and smartphone market. Automotive and smart factories are high potential areas to bring back the growth in semiconductor market.<br><br>In this series of articles published every week we will providefour analysis on each segment of semiconductor chips and also various application areas. We will also provide vendor wise analysis.<br><br>Let's also look at how further deep node diving to 5 nm is helping the market.<br><br><br>Major shift in chip market. US Korea down, India and China up.<br><br>Huawei and Cypress dependency<br><br>Hisilicon a branch of Huawei grew 40% in 2018
