                    <p>
                    Sigma Designs has announced that Japan’s Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, and Telecommunications, has approved a radio frequency range for low-power RF device usage in Japan. As a direct result, Sigma Z-Wave-based control and automation devices for smart homes and small business can be used in the region without the need for radio station licensing.<br><br>“With the Japan market now open for RF-based home control, there will be a very significant market opportunity opening up for Sigma Designs,” said Gabi Hilevitz, vice-president and general manager Connectivity Group at Sigma Designs. “Sigma is already an established leader in home control and automation applications in dozens of countries and we are already in discussions with major device manufacturers in Japan who share Sigma’s excitement about the home control market opportunity.”<br><br>“We are extremely pleased that our new Z-Wave-based controller is among the first to be certified with the new frequency for Japan,” said Yasushi Shimazu, Executive Officer, General Manager, Environment Technology Dept. ICT Division, IWATSU ELECTRIC CO., LTD. “We are proud of our company’s rich heritage as a leader in the market, and believe that the frequency certification for home and office control and energy management devices will open up many new opportunities for us.”
