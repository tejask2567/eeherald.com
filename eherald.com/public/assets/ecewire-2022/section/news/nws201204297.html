                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    IBM has announced that two industry leaders Asahi Kasei and Central Glass to join its Battery 500 Project team and collaborate in doing research where battery going to be primary power source for vehicles.<br><br>IBM Research is developing lithium-air battery technology capable to increase the mileage of electric car for approximately 500 miles (800 km) on a single charge, which is what the most important thing real electric car user is asking for.<br><br>As partners in the Battery 500 Project, Asahi Kasei and Central Glass to bring materials innovation for the automotive industry to the team. Asahi Kasei makes separator membrane for lithium-ion batteries, and is partnering with IBM to use its experience in innovative membrane technology to create a critical component for lithium-air batteries.<br><br>Central Glass is a electrolyte manufacturer for lithium-ion batteries, to use its chemical expertise in this field to create a new class of electrolytes and high-performance additives specifically designed to improve lithium-air batteries.<br><br>"These new partners share our vision of electric cars being critical components of building a cleaner, better world, which is far less dependent on oil," said Dr. Winfried Wilcke, IBM's Principle Investigator who initiated the Battery 500 Project. "Their compatible experience, knowledge and commitment to bold innovation in electric vehicle battery technology can help us transfer this research from the lab onto the road."<br><br>New materials development is vitally important to ensuring the viability of lithium-air battery technology," said Tatsuya Mori, Director, Executive Managing Officer, Central Glass. "As a long-standing partner of IBM and leader in developing high-performance electrolytes for batteries, we're excited to share each other's chemical and scientific expertise in a field as exciting as electric vehicles."<br><br>"We are very focused on addressing environmental challenges and limitations with diverse technology to build a brighter future. This alliance allows us to explore a new path to developing an improved rechargeable battery performance that can not be met with conventional technologies," said Tetsuro Ohta, Head of Advanced Battery Materials Development Center, Asahi Kasei.
