                    <p>
                    Wind River has announced that Fastwel has become a member of the Wind River Partner Alliance Program. The partnership is to provide strong, application-ready platforms to Fastwel customers around the world within a cross-section of sectors, including aerospace and defense, industrial and transportation.<br><br>Fastwel, through this collaboration, can now ship board support packages for Wind River VxWorks that enable customers to easily use Fastwel hardware with Wind River products. The two companies are also to accelerate the application safety or security process by providing certified hardware pre-integrated with Wind River operating systems and certification evidence, along with test management and validation tools.<br><br>"Wind River continues to expand its commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) standards-based hardware and software solutions for critical designs." said Christian Siegl, channel manager EMEA at Wind River. "End users will see a significant reduction in time-to-market due to the speeding up of the hardware and OS integration phase of the embedded application development cycle. This will shorten the overall application development time for critical systems."<br><br>"This collaboration will enable our Wind River customers to rapidly and efficiently use multi-core technologies adopted by Fastwel hardware," said Alekseenko Ilya, business development director, Fastwel. "This opens up the Russian mission-critical systems market with COTS products and allows developers to rapidly differentiate their products via Wind River middleware."
