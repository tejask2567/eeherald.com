                  <p class="title-text"> Agilent sets up terahertz lab at the University of Leeds </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Agilent Technologies has opened terahertz measurement laboratory at the University of Leeds, U.K. The lab is set up in memory of professor Roger Pollard, former dean of engineering at the University of Leeds, who passed away at the end of last year. The lab is equipped with Agilent 1.1-THz PNA network analyzer.<br><br>Agilent says the PNA THz network analyser supports a broad range of projects in nanoelectronics, complemented by a new electron-beam lithography facility. In the new field of graphene, the network analyzer will allow the university staff to perform on-wafer terahertz measurements of transistors, THz biosensors, magnetic storage elements, THz spin-switches and novel acoustoelectric devices. It will also be used to characterise THz passive components such as filters, waveguides, fibres and antennas.<br><br>"This laboratory is a fitting tribute to Roger," said Graham Newton, district manager, UK, for Agilent's Electronic Measurement Group, " both in terms of providing a location for cutting-edge research as well as reflecting the close relationship Roger had with us over so many years."<br><br>"Roger's technical brilliance contributed to many innovations in network analyzers, calibration, and measurement science that Agilent brought to the marketplace," said Henri Komrij, business manager, Component Test Division, Agilent. "His leadership abilities motivated engineers to be more creative, collaborative and innovative. Roger absolutely loved development - of engineering and people. A high-frequency lab named for Dr. Pollard at Leeds, an esteemed university, is a truly appropriate honor for a well-regarded colleague."
