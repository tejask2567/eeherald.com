                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    SCL Elements Inc. has announced the integration of EnOcean and ZigBee technologies into Niagara based building automation systems. This enables the Niagara community to extend their use of wireless solutions and reduce wiring and repair costs for energy efficiency commissioning and retrofit deployments.<br><br>The integration of EnOcean and ZigBee based products to Niagara based JACE's is performed through CAN2GO controllers which support bidirectional EnOcean and ZigBee communication and push the wireless points to JACE hardware via BACnet or Obix. The integration covers HVAC, lighting, occupancy, metering and other building applications.<br><br>"Being at the forefront of building integration, it is very important for us to continue expanding the wireless options to our community. CAN2GO's expertise in wireless multi-protocol integration will allow our partners to take advantage of the wireless wave and offer fast payback periods in the retrofit and mid-market building segment." said Marc Petock, vice president, global marketing and communications for Tridium.<br><br>The use of wireless sensors, actuators and other similar products will enable building automation contractors to accelerate their system installation process and reduce deployment costs. They will also be able to address markets where wiring is deemed too costly, such as buildings with mandatory conduit for wiring, hospitality and retail buildings that can't afford downtime, industrial and warehouse buildings, heritage buildings, buildings that could have asbestos in the walls, etc.<br><br>"Every building is different and system integrators benefit from having multiple options at their fingertips to match client needs. Offering both the EnOcean and ZigBee options with the Niagara community will allow them to expand their energy efficiency solutions that are less costly and less invasive on deployment." said Simon Leblond, CEO of SCL Elements Inc.
