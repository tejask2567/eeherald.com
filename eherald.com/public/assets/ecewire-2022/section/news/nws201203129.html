                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    The researcher Zepu Wang at Rensselaer Polytechnic has developed a new advanced insulation material to coat electrical components and wires so that they can withstand higher voltages.<br><br>Wang's project is titled "Nanocomposite Filled with Graphene Oxide-A Revolutionary Field Grading Material for High-Voltage Power Systems,".<br><br>Using this material as insulation coating High-voltage direct current (HVDC) power systems can handle higher than 800KV.<br><br>The release explains within HVDC systems, particular areas including bushings, cable termination, and joints are often weak points prone to electrical failure. Field grading materials are used to reduce the stress on these weak points. Wang has developed a new field grading material that offers several advantages to those commonly used today. His patent-pending material is a composite of polymers and graphene, the thinnest material known to science. Wang's device requires less costly nanomaterials, exhibits significantly better field grading effects, and has shown to be more durable and less susceptible to overheating than commercial devices, as per the release.
