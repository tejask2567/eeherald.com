                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Kilopass Technology has announced that its XPM (eXtra Permanent Memory) IP is designed into a new integrated circuit for a micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer sensor targeting portable devices and tablets. MaruLSI Ltd., a fabless semiconductor company based in Gyeonggi-do Province, South Korea, is designing the readout chip for MEMS sensors.<br><br>Jung Hyun Nam, Ph.D., president and CEO of MaruLSI said “When we evaluated different solutions for providing trim data for the A/D converter in the system-on-chip design we were building for our customer, we needed a proven solution, that could be implemented in 180nm standard logic CMOS at our foundry with a roadmap to smaller geometries and alternative foundries. Kilopass XPM IP met all these requirements.”<br><br>“We are thrilled to be part of the MaruLSI chip design for the MEMS accelerometer sensor,” said Linh Hong, vice president of marketing at Kilopass. “This application is ideally suited to our one-time programmable, antifuse, NVM IP technology, which has a track record for meeting the rigorous operating temperature and reliability standards for consumer designs. Our NVM IP is installed in 20 million set-top boxes, 50 million DVD chip sets, 100 million Wi-Fi modules, and 500 million FM tuners.”
