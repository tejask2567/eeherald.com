                    <p>
                    BroadSoft, Inc. has launched www.MonetizeLTE.com for rapidly monetizing investments in LTE networks and services.<br><br>The majority of mobile operators are planning to launch LTE services in 2012 or 2013, and 70% of these operators believe there is a viable business case today to launch 4G/LTE services, according to a 2012 survey by Informa Telecoms & Media. The ability of service providers to capitalize on this opportunity to deliver advanced applications and services only possible through LTE - including Voice over LTE (VoLTE), mobile video calling and conferencing, instant messaging and presence and web collaboration - will further shape the future of mobile broadband communications, according to BroadSoft.<br><br>"Service providers globally have invested significantly in LTE as the path towards delivering new, innovative unified communications (UC) services, in addition to voice, to enterprise users and consumers," said Michael Tessler, President and Chief Executive Officer, BroadSoft. "But despite the feverish activity around LTE, we felt service providers lacked an unbiased, comprehensive resource for accessing unique market data and trends, case studies, knowledge communities and industry thought leadership. It is for this reason we launched MonetizeLTE.com."<br><br>One of the most useful features of www.MonetizeLTE.com is an interactive global map tracking real-time progress of LTE network rollouts by country and region. Additional site components include:<br>New LTE research and market trends - Site visitors will have access to the latest research and market trends on a range of LTE topics, including the progress of service provider LTE network rollouts, spectrum developments, as well as consumer and enterprise adoption of LTE-enabled unified communications services.<br>Insightful thought leadership - Site visitors will have access to expert commentary and analysis from industry voices and analysts, including guest articles and video interviews.<br>Case studies - As more service providers launch LTE-enabled unified communications services, site visitors will benefit from real-world service provider case studies on the benefits and challenges associated with monetizing LTE.<br>Community forum - The website will feature an open community forum for service providers and others across the global communications ecosystem to connect, exchange knowledge and learn about everything and anything LTE.<br><br>Scott Hoffpauir, Chief Technology Officer, BroadSoft, adds: "As LTE networks evolve from launch phase to maturation, MonetizeLTE.com will adapt with additional content and perspectives that reflect new challenges that emerge. We hope the site becomes the destination of choice for everyone involved with LTE, unified communications and mobile broadband to connect, learn and of course, monetize their LTE efforts."<br><br>Source: BroadSoft
