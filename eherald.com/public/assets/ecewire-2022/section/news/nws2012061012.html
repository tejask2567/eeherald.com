                    <p>
                    Ericsson has released the second traffic and market report - On the Pulse of the Networked Society.<br>The aim of its report is to share analysis based on the measurements, internal forecasts and other relevant studies to provide insights into the current traffic and market trends.<br><br>The report reveals that by 2017, 85 percent of the world's population is expected to have 3G internet coverage and the mobile subscriptions including machine-to-machine subscriptions to reach nine billion, compared to six billion by the end of 2011.<br><br>The mobile broadband subscriptions are forecast to reach five billion in 2017, compared to one billion by the end of 2011.<br><br>Other predictions:<br>1. By 2017 half of the world's population will be covered by LTE/4G networks<br>2. Smartphone subscriptions will reach around three billion in 2017 when compared to 700 million in     2011<br>3. Total mobile data traffic continues to increase - between Q1 2011 and Q1 2012 data traffic doubled -     and the prime driver is video. Smartphones are also, and will remain, a key data traffic driver. The     mobile data traffic will grow by 15 times between 2011 and 2017<br>4. The data shows variations between countries and regions. In the case of mobile net additions,      China added the most subscriptions for a single country in Q1 2012 with 39 million, followed by      India with 25 million. The Asia Pacific region added in total 93 million subscriptions, followed by      Africa with 30 million.<br>5. The main continuous trend identified is that everything is going mobile. This evolution is mainly      being driven by people's increasing demand for anywhere, anytime connectivity and the use of video,      cloud-based services and the internet - but also by machine-to-machine connectivity.<br>6. For many people around the world, the mobile phone will be the only means of accessing the     internet.<br><br>Douglas Gilstrap, senior vice president and head of Strategy, Ericsson says: "Today, people see access to the internet as a prerequisite for any device. This mindset results in growing demand for mobile broadband and increased data traffic. Operators recognize this business opportunity and are aiming to facilitate this growth and provide good user experience with fast data speeds through high capacity networks. Today, around 75% of the HSPA networks worldwide have been upgraded to a peak speed of 7.2 Mbps or above and around 40% has been upgraded to 21 Mbps."<br><br>To download the full report www.ericsson.com/traffic-market-report
