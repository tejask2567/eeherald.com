                  <p class="title-text"> Kazuyoshi Yamada replaces Hitoshi Yoshizawa as Cypress’ VP of Japan sales </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cypress Semiconductor Corp. has announced that Kazuyoshi “Kazu” Yamada has been named country manager of Cypress Japan. Kazu reports to senior vice president of worldwide sales, Ben Lee and he replaces Hitoshi Yoshizawa. Dr. Yoshizawa retires after a distinguished career of 40 years, the last four as Cypress Japan country manager. The change becomes effective on July 1, 2012, at which time Dr. Yoshizawa will assume the role of non-executive chairman of Cypress Japan.<br><br>Yamada joined Cypress in 2011 as vice president of Japan strategic accounts, reporting to Yoshizawa. He previously served in senior leadership roles at NEC’s semiconductor group and at Renesas for more than 33 years. He left Renesas as senior vice president of the System-on-Chip business unit where he was responsible for ASICs, ASSPs and synchronous SRAM products. He started his career as an ASIC designer and worked in Silicon Valley for 17 years. Yamada holds BSEE and MSEE degrees from Tokyo City University.<br><br>Dr. Yoshizawa’s career spanned almost 40 years. In his years at Cypress, Dr. Yoshizawa, drove broad adoption of many flagship Cypress solutions in the Japanese market, including TrueTouch touchscreen controllers, PSoC programmable system-on-chip devices, USB controllers and SRAMs. Cypress Japan’s revenue grew over 80 percent under Dr. Yoshizawa’s leadership.<br><br>“Yoshizawa-san exemplified inspirational leadership and sound management in growing our organization and business in Japan. We thank him for his outstanding contributions to Cypress. He has established strong relationships with customers as well as our distribution partners in Japan. We look forward to continued contributions in his new role,” said Ben Lee. “Our Japan business operation is running well as we pass the reins to Kazu. We are eager to see this success continue and expand with Kazu’s unique blend of experience, energy and knowledge of the semiconductor industry in both Japan and the U.S.”<br><br>“I am pleased that Cypress Japan will be in Kazu’s capable hands,” said Dr. Yoshizawa. “It has been rewarding and enjoyable building Cypress Japan into a very successful business operation, and I will be eagerly watching to see the continued progress under Kazu.”<br><br>“I am excited to lead Cypress Japan,” Yamada said. “Cypress has the strongest product line-up in our history, combined with excellent operations and a very talented staff in Japan. I look forward to working with our broad customer base in Japan to provide leading-edge solutions and services, and to extend our success into high-growth markets such as energy management, intelligent factory automation and automotive.”
