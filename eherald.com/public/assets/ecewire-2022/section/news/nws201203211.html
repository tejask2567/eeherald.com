                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Xilinx has increased its research facility size by more than 2X in India at Hi-Tech city, Hyderabad. The 131,000 square-foot office has engineering labs and collaboration space for end-to-end product development, an energy-efficient data center, and expanded facilities for customer and employee events.<br><br>Xilinx President and CEO, Moshe Gavrielov, Senior Vice President of Programmable Platforms Development, Victor Peng, and Xilinx India Site Director and CTO, Vamsi Boppana, have inaugrated the ceremony by lighting the lamp.<br><br>Xilinx is one of the top semiconductor investor in India. Generally fables Xilinx is first customer for the new nodes by leading semiconductor fabs such as TSMC. Xilinx leverages extensively its Indian sources in developing 28nm chips. Among the FPGA chip vendors, Xilinx has higher market share in the Indian FPGA market and is also growing fast, as per our estimates. Lattice and Microsemi are other FPGA companies who have invested in tapping Indian R&D talent as well as adressing the local market.<br><br>While India is already a hub for silicon software, expansion by Xilinx creates more job opportunities for VLSI design engineers.<br><br>"We're proud to commemorate the opening of our new Hyderabad site today and to celebrate the incredible contributions of our employees in India," said Gavrielov at inauguration ceremonies. "The Xilinx India engineering team will continue to play a pivotal role in our success as part of Xilinx's world-class PPD engineering organization. Notably, more than half the Zynq engineering team is based in India, with some aspects entirely designed and verified in India. The India team has sole ownership and development responsibility for significant aspects of our next-generationtool suite accelerating programmable design productivity."
