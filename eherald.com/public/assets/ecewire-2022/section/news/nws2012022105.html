                    Arteris' FlexNoC interconnect IP are to be used with Synopsys' Platform Architect environment to simulate realistic system-level performance of their end product architectures. SystemC transaction-level models (TLMs) generated by Arteris' FlexNoC configuration tool can now be easily united with Synopsys' architecture design models and traffic generators.<br><br>"In our research, we've found that almost half of project delays are caused by problems with the system architecture design and specification," said Chris Rommel, vice president, embedded software and hardware, VDC Research. "Many of these architecture problems are related to escalating SoC complexity, including multicore requirements. Therefore, solutions like the one developed by Synopsys and Arteris to efficiently analyze multicore SoC architectures early in the design flow should become increasingly valuable as engineering teams look for ways to help improve project schedules and performance results."<br><br>"Arteris FlexNoC's integration with Synopsys' Platform Architect MCO environment allows our customers to create better SoCs in less time," said K. Charles Janac, president and CEO of Arteris. "Integration of the two technologies allows SoC designers to have the same quick turn-around simulation times they experience today with FlexNoC, while gaining critical benefits from the more realistic simulation and earlier analysis of their application scenarios."<br><br>"Our goal is to help system designers and architects avoid late discovery of system performance problems that can be extremely costly for both project schedules and budgets," said John Koeter, vice president of marketing for IP and systems at Synopsys. "By starting architecture analysis and optimization at the transaction-level with Arteris' FlexNoC interconnect models in Synopsys' Platform Architect MCO, we offer SoC architects the ability to perform accurate simulation of the multicore system and its most critical application use-cases earlier. With this combination they can achieve the best balance of performance, power and cost at a time in the development process where they have the greatest impact."<br><br>Availability: Arteris and Synopsys' integration is available today for users of Arteris FlexNoC version 2.6 or later, and Synopsys' Platform Architect MCO tool version F-2011.06-SP2 or later.
