                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Entegris announced it is investing  approximately $200 million over the next three to five years in Taiwan to expand its manufacturing operations in Taiwan.<br><br>Entegris to start new construction at Southern Taiwan’s Kaohsiung Science Park in early 2021 and start initial operations in late 2021. The initial 27,000 square-meter facility to make solutions such as filters for microcontamination control, gas delivery systems, advanced chemistries, and other Entegris products and services. <br><br>According to Bertrand Loy, Entegris’ president and chief executive officer, expanding the company’s manufacturing capacity reflects the increased and growing demand for its products and services from leading global manufacturers of semiconductors in Taiwan and the broader Asia Pacific region. Based on IC Insights’ Global Wafer Capacity report in 2020, nearly 22% of the global semiconductor wafer fab capacity is in Taiwan while the Asia region, including Taiwan, Korea, China, and Japan, produce approximately 75% of all global semiconductors.<br><br>“Taiwan is a well-established global leader in the semiconductor industry, and with this expanded presence we will be well positioned to be even more responsive to our customers’ emerging needs as we work closely with them to accelerate their development cycles and product ramps. In addition, our closer proximity will strengthen supply security to our customers in the region while supplementing our expansive manufacturing capacity throughout Asia in South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and China,” Loy said.<br><br>Alvin Hsieh, Entegris Taiwan country president, said, “Entegris’ presence in Taiwan spans 30 years and this expansion of our manufacturing and R&D facilities represents an important next phase in the company’s ongoing commitment to the industry and the region. We will leverage advanced automation, digitalization, and analytical tools in this state-of-the-art facility to achieve the highest standards of quality and productivity as we respond to the rapidly evolving needs of our customers.”<br><br>Minister Mei-Hua Wang with the Taiwanese Ministry of Economic Affairs commented about Entegris’ planned expansion: “We are happy to see Entegris building upon its three-decade presence and ongoing investment in Taiwan and its leadership role within the global semiconductor industry. The company’s planned expansion will help Taiwan accumulate and broaden significant innovation capacity in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector and further strengthen Taiwan’s expertise and ecosystem. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to provide full support to Entegris and to help the semiconductor industry advance and prosper.”
