                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    IBM has come out with an IT solution for energy providers, electric car manufacturers, and charging point owners to share and integrate services on one common IT platform. This will create a network of EV charging services that are compatible regionally in Europe.<br><br>Electric car owners can charge their cars at any charge-point location and pay in any location across regions. The data of charging a particular car at any charging station is communicated to different energy utility companies who are part of the system. This way electric car used need not get any permission or pay whenever the car needs charging. The driver is also can be provided with nearest charging stations in the range. This takes away the fear of electric car owner running out of charge.<br><br>This initiative is funded by the European Union with the goal to establish a Europe-wide infrastructure for electric vehicles by 2015. This is part of the broader European Recovery Plan to reduce C02 emissions by 60 percent by the year 2050.<br><br>"This marketplace will pave the way for the electromobility mass market in Europe. It allows for open access to charging spots throughout Europe thus making the journey with an e-car simple and convenient," said Dr. Heike Barlag, Siemens AG, Project Coordinator Green eMotion.<br><br>Based on IBM software and IBM SmartCloud Enterprise, IBM says the project creates a scalable open-standards environment that enables manufacturers and service providers to link their various services according to consumer and industry requirements. Using analytic software, participants will also have the insight to develop new or improved services to support more electric vehicles as the market grows. Green eMotion partners such as Enel, SAP and Siemens developed the required EV services, says IBM.<br><br>"Green eMotion is spearheading many key developments that have the potential to reinvent Europe's complex transportation system and energy infrastructure. For other countries around the world, there is a lot to be learned from this initiative," said Clay Luthy, IBMGlobal Distributed Energy Resource Leader. "Our goal is to help add a new layer of intelligence to the electric vehicle market and a new level of convenience to the driver through the Green eMotion project. We believe the demonstration project will foster innovation and further transformation across a larger geographical footprint."<br><br>For more details, visit http://www.greenemotion-project.eu/home/index.php.
