                    <p>
                    STMicroelectronics has launched the 2012 iNEMO design contest for students and young engineers in Taiwan to design innovative applications built around ST's iNEMO smart multi-sensor technology.<br><br>ST's iNEMO is an evaluation and development tool that offers up to 10 degrees of freedom, combining 3-axis linear acceleration, 3-axis angular rate and 3-axis motion sensing through a magnetic field, together with barometric/altitude readings, managed by an STM32 32-bit microcontroller. Along with the integration of the processing capabilities, applications can be found in gaming, human machine interface, robotics, portable navigation devices, and patient monitoring.<br><br>"Building upon the success achieved in the previous year, when nearly 145 students and young engineers in Taiwan submitted 32 designs to the 2011 iNEMO contest, we have continued to witness innovation and creativity among young students and engineers in Taiwan," said Patrick Boulaud, STMicroelectronics regional vice president, Analog, MEMS and Sensor, Greater China and South Asia region. "This year's contest enables ST to continue to drive MEMS industry growth with its innovation capabilities and with its commitment to developing and cultivating talent among university students and young engineers around the world. The iNEMO Design Contest in Taiwan is yet another example of how ST demonstrates its commitment to global innovation and excellence."<br><br>The iNEMO Design Contest will run in Taiwan until November 15, 2012 and offers total prizes in excess of NT$195,000 to the ten most successful iNEMO design concepts, evaluated on their functionality and practicality, implementation, creativity, presentation and final demonstration. The winners will be announced at the beginning of December 2012.<br><br>STMicroelectronics has also launched the 2012 iNEMO design contest for students and young engineers in China to design innovative applications built around ST's iNEMO smart multi-sensor technology.<br><br>The iNEMO design contest will run in China until November, 22 2012 and offers total prizes in excess of RMB62,000 to the six most successful iNEMO design concepts, evaluated on their functionality and practicality, implementation, creativity, presentation and final demonstration.<br><br>For more information for registration, visit http://2012inemo.eccn.com
