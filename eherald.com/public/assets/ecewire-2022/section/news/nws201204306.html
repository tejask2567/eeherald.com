                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Open-Silicon, Inc has expanded its solutions offering for semiconductor and system companies to include architectural analysis and modeling, pre-silicon prototyping, embedded software, co-silicon system design and test, and post-silicon validation.<br><br>Open-Silicon has added development capabilities such as embedded Linux on multi-core ARM Cortex-A9, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) using Linux and RTOS, integration of the latest generation of high-speed IO peripherals, integration of open-source networking and communication stacks, multi FPGA partitioning and synthesis, early software development using prototypes, and platform- and system-level silicon validation. These additions help companies to use Open-Silicon at any point in their design cycle for collaborative engineering and a faster time to market.<br><br>The Pune design center is equipped with state-of-the-art FPGA prototyping platforms, project specific development boards, system tests and debug facilities.<br><br>"The addition of product design capabilities including emulation, validation and embedded software development to our traditional strength in ASIC design and manufacturing means that our customers can now find complete semiconductor solutions under one roof. This consolidation of capabilities under one organization relieves a lot of the hand-holding needed when using various vendors, and through familiarity with a design enables faster time to market," said Shrikrishna Gokhale, chief operating officer and managing director of Open-Silicon, India. "Our goal remains to provide tailor-made solutions to our customers that will give them a competitive edge."
