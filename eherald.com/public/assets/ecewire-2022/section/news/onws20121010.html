                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Bridgelux Inc. has announced the installation of nearly 2000 modern LED-based luminaires utilizing Bridgelux ES and RS LED arrays for two new retail stores opening in India developed for its customer, FUTURE GROUP. The use of LED-based technology, instead of conventional metal halide lighting, in these two retail stores is predicted to save 318,000 KwH per year or about 2.5 million Rupees (US$38,000) in power costs.<br><br>“The product design and lighting concept developed using Bridgelux’s LED technology was a perfect match for our retail environment. Our retail lighting requirements are very demanding. But we were sold by a combination of mock-up demonstrations and an understanding of the benefits that could be achieved with this innovative technology. We were convinced that we could enhance the quality of lighting to improve the customer experience while simultaneously reducing our operational costs,” said Sunil Biyani, Director, Future Group.<br><br>“We selected Bridgelux LED arrays to use in our new luminaires because the Bridgelux technology gave us superior performance, in terms of lumen output, consistency, and light quality when compared to other LED light sources,” said R. Hari, chief innovation officer, Asian Retail Lighting Ltd. “We decided that LED arrays or chip-on-board (COB) light sources were the right technology to provide the best quality of light to attract more customers into the stores. Arrays also gave us the design flexibility to create a broad range of new luminaires optimized to display the merchandise with the greatest appeal to the customer.”<br><br>The new stores, Pantaloon, in Market City, Velachery, Chennai and the Central store in Cochin, Kerala are using a combination of downlights, wall washers and track lights all designed by Asian Retail Lighting and using Bridgelux LED arrays. Pantaloon sells high-end clothing and life style merchandise. Central is a seamless, multi-brand retail store.<br>For more information: www.bridgelux.com<br><br>Source: Bridgelux
