                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    In today's world most of the common IC chips are made up of silicon semiconductor material. Though many engineers have learned the physics and applications of VLSI IC chips in colleges. They are not exposed to semiconductor IC manufacturing. The silicon-material-making and using the silicon for making billions of nano-devices is a complex process using expensive equipment. Only few institutes/colleges have a mini-fab to teach how to make semiconductor chips. One such institute in India is Indian Institute of Technology Bombay(IITB). IITB in collaboration with leading semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials is offering 7-day long course in semiconductor IC chip manufacturing.<br><br>With India expecting couple of semiconductor fabs, there is immediate need of work-force with semiconductor fab skills. India is moving into electronics manufacturing in a big way, the reason is huge consumption of electronics. As per a study by The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India and Frost & Sullivan the Indian electronics consumption will grow to US$ 400 billion by 2020 and if the industry’s manufacturing rate does not improve, it would be able to produce only 20% of the projected requirement. The study indicated that it is critical to develop a skilled workforce to meet the high demand for manufacturing electronic devices. So there are plenty of jobs going to be created in semiconductor manufacturing.<br><br>"The new program synergizes with the efforts of Department of Electronics and IT, Government of India, to promote electronics system design and manufacturing, and specifically to set up semiconductor wafer fabs in the country. The program addresses a felt need as it will be the first step to develop human resources for the fab industry in the country. I congratulate IIT Bombay for having taken the lead in setting up the certificate training program and thank Applied Materials for the support provided in this direction. I wish the program all success." said Dr. Ajay Kumar, Joint Secretary, Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.<br><br>“IIT Bombay has strong research, development and education initiatives in the area of semiconductor technology to support semiconductor manufacturing in India. Training a specialized workforce for such an industry is an important priority. The Semiconductor Technology and Manufacturing Certification Course is a result of IITB and Applied Materials’ long-standing relationship in the area of research collaboration and is a fine example of industry and academia working together to help build a strong talent pool for the high-tech industry,” said Professor Devang Khakhar, Director, IIT Bombay.<br><br>Dr. Omkaram Nalamasu, Chief Technology Officer, Applied Materials, said, “Concerted efforts by the Government of India, research and educational institutions and industry are needed to make semiconductor manufacturing a sustainable reality in India. The Indian government is enabling the creation of an ecosystem that will promote research in nano-electronics to drive expertise and competence in these fields. The Semiconductor Technology and Manufacturing Certification Course is the first of its kind in India and is a significant milestone in the continued effort by IIT Bombay and Applied Materials to develop an Indian semiconductor ecosystem.”<br><br>This 1-week IC chip making course from IITB to cover VLSI semiconductor technologies, processes and the basic concepts of microelectronics manufacturing with hands-on training on semiconductor equipment from Applied Materials. The IITB faculty members and experts from Applied Materials to provide training.<br><br>Continued Education Programme (CEP) certificate are awarded by IITB for the successfully completed candidates.<br><br>If you need to get familiar with semiconductor basics such as silicon converting into chip, we suggest you to watch two videos to learn VLSI chip making basics.<br><br>The two video are available at:<br>How do they Make Semiconductors? at<br>http://www.sia-online.org/media_center/video_center/<br><br>Factory tour of IC manufacturing at:<br>http://cn.renesas.com/company_info/v_factory/index.jsp<br><br>To brush up your theoretical knowledge on semiconductor physics read the pdf file from Dinesh Sharma, Microelectronics group, EE Department, IIT Bombay at<br><br>http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~smdp/DKStutorials/basics.pdf<br><br>The last date to apply for the course by IITB is 19th October 2012.<br>More details available at www.iitb.ac.in/~cep/<br>and brochure at http://www.iitb.ac.in/~cep/brochures/2012/slodha-bro-12.pdf
