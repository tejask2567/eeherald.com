                    <p>
                    Crocus Technology and SMIC have announced a new strategic manufacturing agreement. As per the agreement SMIC to supply CMOS wafers to produce Magnetic Logic Unit (MLU) devices at 90nm, 65nm and 45nm nodes, with a path to process the entire flow. The wafers will be used to manufacture embedded micro-controllers based on Crocus' novel MLU technology.<br><br>Crocus says Magnetic Logic Unit (MLU) is a CMOS based rugged magnetic technology capable of offering important advantages in performance, size and security for embedded microcontrollers. MLUs solutions are used in mobile and security applications, such as smart cards and secure data servers. Crocus' MLUs are also ideally suited to new applications in extreme operating conditions, particularly in high temperature automotive and industrial equipment.<br><br>Crocus has placed its first orders with SMIC to supply 200mm CMOS wafers, which will be delivered for magnetic processing by year-end.<br><br>"SMIC is one of the leading foundry wafer providers in the world with whom Crocus has been a long time partner," said Bertrand Cambou, executive chairman of Crocus Technology. "With SMIC as a partner supplier of various critical wafers, our production can speed forward, thereby accelerating the availability of MLU-based solutions to our customers in the smartcard and other industries."<br><br>In addition to SMIC manufacturing and supplying CMOS base wafers on multiple technology nodes for further processing at CNE, Crocus' advanced magnetic manufacturing facility, SMIC will also supply 300mm full flow MLU wafers, which includes the Crocus' magnetic process layer.<br><br>Crocus says it expects to deliver several hundred million secure micro-controllers to the smart card industry over the next three years.
