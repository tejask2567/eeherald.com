                    <p>
                    ANSYS and its subsidiary Apache Design have announced that their RedHawk and Totem products achieved TSMC Phase I 20-nm certification. TSMC certified the tools for 20 nanometer design rule manuals (DRMs) and SPICE models.<br><br>RedHawk and Totem provide power, noise and reliability signoff for system-on-chip and mixed-signal designs at advanced technology nodes. Red Hawk addresses electro-migration by delivering the checks which are aware of current direction, metal topology and temperature. Red Hawk also tackles expanded capabilities to support TSMC's 20nm electro-migration rules. Totem provides full-chip, layout-based power and noise analysis for analog and mixed-signal designs.<br><br>ANSYS technologies interface with TSMC's 3D-IC flow to deliver accurate thermal profiles through iterative analysis of power maps and boundary conditions.<br>"Apache delivers innovative solutions that address power, noise and reliability challenges for the most advanced process nodes and emerging design technologies," said Andrew Yang, president of Apache, a subsidiary of ANSYS. "Our collaboration with TSMC enables us to provide optimized tools and methodologies for advanced-technology designers."<br><br>"With ANSYS and Apache 20nm certification at TSMC, companies will be able to produce more robust designs and deliver next-generation products to the marketplace," said Suk Lee, TSMC senior director, design infrastructure marketing division.
