                    CEVA, Inc has announced that it has been ranked by a research firm The Linley Group as the worldwide leader in DSP IP shipments in 2011, with a 90% market share. The market share numbers were published in The Linley Group's recent report, titled 'A Guide to CPU Cores and Processor IP'.<br><br>"CEVA continues to be the most successful supplier of DSP IP - its licensees shipped more than one billion chips in 2011," said J. Scott Gardner, an analyst at The Linley Group and co-author of A Guide to CPU Cores and Processor IP. "CEVA has an impressive customer base for its DSP portfolio, especially in communications and multimedia. Furthermore, with the 4G transition well underway, high-performance programmable DSPs are required to efficiently handle complex multimode baseband processing. CEVA is well positioned to capitalize on this trend."<br><br>"CEVA is pleased to be ranked yet again as the worldwide leader in DSP IP by The Linley Group," said Gideon Wertheizer, CEO of CEVA. "Our unrivalled expertise in DSP technology for high volume mobile and digital home applications drives our success and is the reason we are the DSP-of-choice for many of the world's leading semiconductors and OEMs."<br><br>CEVA's DSP cores power many of the semiconductors today for a broad range of applications including cellular baseband, imaging, vision, audio, voice, voice-over-IP and more.<br><br>CEVA's latest generation communications DSP architecture framework, the CEVA-XC4000, addresses advanced wireless standard, including LTE-Advanced, Wi-Fi 802.11ac and DTV demodulation. The new CEVA-TeakLite-4 DSP architecture framework for advanced audio and voice processing introduces innovative smart power management technology and supports customer owned extensions.<br><br>Independent analysis of both the CEVA-XC4000 and the CEVA-TeakLite-4 DSP architecture frameworks was recently published in The Linley Group's Microprocessor report.
