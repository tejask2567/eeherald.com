                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cambridge Pixel has announced a technology transfer agreement with Samsung Thales Corporation (STC) to supply its radar processing and display technology.<br><br>As part of this new agreement, Cambridge Pixel is to offer core technology products, technology transfer and training to allow STC to develop, customise and support its own radar solutions. Cambridge Pixel’s SPx product family that includes radar scan converter, radar video simulator and network video distribution, are being supplied to STC for localisation.<br><br>For Samsung Thales Corporation, Mr. Yong OoK Lee, Naval/System R&D Centre Leader, said: “STC has significant project experience developing radar solutions for our naval customers. For new programmes, we wanted to work with a long term partner that is able to provide us with a cost-effective, flexible solution as well as the expertise, support and training required to enhance our naval combat management system."<br><br>David Johnson, managing director, Cambridge Pixel, commented: “This is a further boost to our growing export business and we are delighted to be supplying our radar processing technology to Samsung Thales in Korea as part of this technology transfer agreement.<br><br>“Our advanced software solution and flexible product architecture is appealing to systems integrators as it makes technology refresh inherently easy as our radar software solution is very cleanly decoupled from the hardware computing platform, thereby avoiding reliance on a specific proprietary solution.<br><br>“We have already started to work alongside STC’s engineers to provide modules of expertise that can be built into new generation radar server and console solutions. We believe the teaming will give STC enhanced capabilities to develop and maintain solutions using Cambridge Pixel’s engineering team as an extension of its own resources.”<br><br>For more information: www.cambridgepixel.com
