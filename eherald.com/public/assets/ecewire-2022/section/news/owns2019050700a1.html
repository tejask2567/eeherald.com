                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Most of the top 10 global electronic component distributors have huge presence in Indian market. Though they are having healthy share of this market, there are good number of new emerging players in this market exclusively targeting only the maker community market.<br><br>The most prominent companies gaining from the electronics maker market boom are online business to consumer shopping portals Amazon and Flipcart. They sell embedded boards, active and passive components, test and measuring instruments such as oscilloscopes and a lot more. Except some high end cutting-edge semiconductor ICs and high precision components, lot of other commonly used major components and boards can be purchased from Amazon and Flipcart. The advantage of buying from Amazon and Flipcart is, they offer cash on delivery, which is preferred way of paying in India. India is still cost sensitive market, that is helping companies such as Amazon and Flipcart and small size distributors to grow in this market.<br><br>To give you a list of small companies exclusively selling electronic components and boards for maker community includes: Nevon express, Robu.in, Protocentral.in, Fabtolab, Mgsuperlab, Rhydolaz.com, Sunrobotics.co.in and Evelta Electronics. This list is hardly complete, however it is made after spending some time online searching for popular boards and components.<br><br>However one should be warned that there are high chances of buying fake and bad quality parts causing significant problems in product development, if they are procured from unverified sources. So one has to ensure to double-check the source and reliability of components when buying from business to consumer portals and small sized online component retailers.
