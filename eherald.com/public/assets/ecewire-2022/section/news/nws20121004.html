                    Infonetics Research has released excerpts from its Cloud and CPE Managed Security Services report, which analyzes and predicts the market for cloud- and customer premises equipment (CPE)–based security services delivered by service providers to small, medium, and large businesses.<br><br>“As the variety of devices, platforms, and apps grows and properly securing them becomes more complex, so grows demand for managed security services, even in the midst of some lingering economic malaise,” notes Jeff Wilson, principal analyst for security at Infonetics Research.<br><br>Wilson adds, “Cloud-based security services in particular are gaining momentum, fueled by North America and greenfield opportunities in developing markets in Asia and Latin America. We’re forecasting global revenue from cloud-based security services to grow 83% from 2011 to 2016, an eyebrow-raising figure, especially in the enormous security market.”<br><br>Cloud and CPE managed security market highlights by Infonetics:<br>1. The volume of network security attacks is up drastically in 2012, with more threats coming—or appearing to come—from trusted sources<br>2. By 2016, spending on managed security services by medium-sized organizations to be on a par with large organizations<br>3. Major Internet and platform companies including Google and Microsoft are integrating content security into their larger business applications offerings<br>4. DDoS services like those provided by Prolexic and Verisign are a major and growing segment that Infonetics may break out in its managed security report when more data is available from providers in this space<br><br>Infonetics’ Cloud and CPE Managed Security Services report contains market size, forecasts, trends and analysis for cloud- and CPE-based managed security services by organization size and by technology: managed firewalls, content security, intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/IPS), and other security services.
