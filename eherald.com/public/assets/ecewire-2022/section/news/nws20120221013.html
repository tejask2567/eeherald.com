                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Integrated Device Technology has announced that the IDT CPS-1848 Gen2 RapidIO(R) switch has been selected by VadaTech Inc for its UTC002 MicroTCA Carrier Hub (MCH) switch cards.<br><br>"We're pleased that VadaTech has selected RapidIO Gen2 and the IDT CPS-1848 switch for its MicroTCA Carrier Hub and switch card," said Tom Sparkman, vice president of the Communications Division at IDT. "VadaTech's selection of IDT RapidIO products is a demonstration of the market's demand for RapidIO-based 20 Gbps low-latency switching in MicroTCA systems. It's another example of why RapidIO continues to thrive in performance-driven markets where its protocol advantages in peer-to-peer networks offer a compelling value proposition."<br><br>"As a performance extension to our UTC001 RapidIO 1.3-enabled MCH using IDT's CPS-10Q switch, we chose IDT's CPS-1848 RapidIO Gen2 switch as the interconnect backbone for the multi-processor systems that our customers need to support inside MicroTCA systems. IDT's solution provided low and deterministic latency, low power and excellent software scalability -- all of which are critical to our MicroTCA customer base," said Saeed Karamooz, CEO at VadaTech. "We have been delivering high-quality MicroTCA Systems to the market with RapidIO 1.3, and moving to RapidIO Gen2 is a natural evolution for our customers. RapidIO allows them to deliver solutions to the end markets that surpass anything that is possible with other mainstream embedded protocols demanded by our MicroTCA customers."
