                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Altera Corporation has announced the joint development of the heterogeneous 3D IC test vehicle using TSMC's Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integration process. Heterogeneous 3D ICs stack analog, logic and memory semiconductor wafers in single module. TSMC's integrated CoWoS process provides semiconductor companies developing 3D ICs an end-to-end solution that includes the front-end manufacturing process and also back-end assembly and test solutions.<br><br>Altera intent to integrate various technologies with an FPGA, including CPUs, ASICs, ASSPs, memory and optics.<br><br>"Our partnerships with standards bodies like IMEC and SEMATECH, and our use of TSMC's leading-edge CoWoS manufacturing and assembly process put us in an excellent position to execute on our strategy of delivering heterogeneous 3D devices to our customers at the right time and with the right set of features," said Bill Hata, senior vice president of worldwide operations and engineering at Altera. "Implementing heterogeneous 3D capabilities into our devices enables us to continue our path of technology innovation and leadership and carry us beyond Moore's Law."<br><br>"Our relationship with Altera dates back nearly two decades and in that time, we have worked closely together to mutually develop the most leading-edge manufacturing processes and semiconductor technologies," said Rick Cassidy, President of TSMC North America. "Developing next-generation 3D ICs with Altera is a good example of how two companies can work together to push semiconductor technology to another level."<br><br>CoWoS is an integrated process technology that attaches device silicon chips to a wafer through a chip on wafer (CoW) bonding process. The CoW chip is attached to the substrate (CoW-On-Substrate) to form the final component. By attaching the device silicon to the original thick wafer silicon before it finishes the fabrication process, manufacturing-induced warping is avoided. TSMC plans to offer CoWoS as a turnkey manufacturing service.
