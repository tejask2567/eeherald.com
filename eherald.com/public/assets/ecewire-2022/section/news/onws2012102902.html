                    Vision-processor System-on-Chip developed by ST and Mobileye using Mobileye’s EyeQ technology is now deployed in more than one million vehicles around the world.<br><br>"The deployment of our millionth device is a major milestone in Mobileye's development and growth, and speaks to the strength of our partnership with STMicroelectronics," said Ziv Aviram, CEO of Mobileye. "More significantly, it exemplifies the growing commitment of global automakers, lawmakers and consumers to making driver safety a top priority, a reality we can all be proud of."<br><br>“Passing the 1 million-chip milestone is just one measure of the strength of our relationship with Mobileye,” said Paul Grimme, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Sales and Marketing EMEA, STMicroelectronics. “We take great pride in continuing our important work with Mobileye and look forward to working together to establish new frontiers of driver-assist applications that deliver improved safety.”
