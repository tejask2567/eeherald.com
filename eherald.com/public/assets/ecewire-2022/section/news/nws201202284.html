                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    STMicroelectronics has shipped an average of 66 Million+ MEMS devices per month in last 15 months. Total MEMS shipments from ST has crossed two billion MEMS sensors to date. With this ST claims number one position in MEMS supplied to consumer and portable applications. ST has crossed 1 billion MEMS shipment only 15 months back.<br><br>ST's MEMS power some of the popular smart phones and tablets in the market. Its MEMS are also widely used for free-fall protection in laptop hard-disk drives.<br><br>ST said its Consumer MEMS sales grew more than 80% in 2011 reaching of total of approximately $650 million, well more than twice as large as its closest competitor, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. The Company continues to be the leading supplier to mobile and consumer manufacturers for both motion-sensor types - accelerometers and gyroscopes. Having captured approximately 50% of the consumer accelerometer market in just a few years, IHS iSuppli credits ST with having achieved even greater success in MEMS gyroscopes, boosting its revenue-based market share in gyroscopes from 1% in 2009 to 70% in 2011.
