                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Japanese electronics engineering company Toshiba has developed a tetrapod robot to replace human being in studying and fixing problems in hazardous areas such as Nuclear power plants and such dangerous environments.<br><br>The remotely controlled robot features a camera and dosimeter to take pictures inside nuclear power plants. It has human like multiple joints legs which are controlled by a dedicated movement algorithm that enables the robot to walk on uneven surfaces, avoid obstacles and climb stairs, securing access into areas that is challenging to be reached by wheeled robots or crawlers. This robot holds another small robot in its folded arm that can be released when required. The smaller robot with camera can take images of narrow places and any equipment behind them, and tubes and other places that are too small for the robot to enter. Small robot is connected to the main robot by a cable.<br><br>Toshiba said it will continue research and development on capabilities and operation of the robot so as to enable it to position and install shielding, stop flows of water and remove obstacles.<br><br>Brief specifications of the tetrapod robot<br>Weight: 65kg<br>Size: 624mm (L) x 587mm (W) x 1066mm (H)<br>Power Source: Battery<br>Battery time: 2 hours (continuous use)<br>Weight Capacity: 20kg<br>Walking Speed: 1km/h<br>Operation: Wireless remote control<br><br>Specs of the second camera on the smaller robot:<br>Weight: 2kg<br>Size: 313mm (L) x 327mm (W) x 47mm (H)<br>Power Source: Battery<br>Battery time: 1 hour<br>Speed: 200m/ h<br>Operation: cable connection with the main robot
