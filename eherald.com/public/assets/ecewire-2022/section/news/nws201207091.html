                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    TEL NEXX, Inc. a subsidiary of Tokyo Electron Limited has reached a new multi-year joint development program in 3D semiconductor packaging with IBM. TEL NEXX is already working closely with IBM R&D in developing new concepts for silicon interposers, lead-free bumping, microbumps, and other metal layer deposition for interconnects. 3D structures is now a production reality. Tel Nexx supplies semiconductor equipments such as deposition tools mainly a equipment named Apollo for physical vapor deposition (PVD), equipment named Stratus for electrochemical deposition (ECD).<br><br>Tom Walsh, TEL NEXX President, commented “The challenges offered through our collaboration with IBM, one of the most distinguished technology innovators in the semiconductor industry, keeps us innovating as a company. The opportunity to work with IBM represents a chance to produce the world’s latest, greatest and most production focused technologies. Enhanced Apollo PVD technology promises an economically efficient solution for barrier seed deposition. Stratus ECD will be deployed in developing plating interconnects, among other 3D structures. We’re aiming to meet levels of productivity and reliability that solve problems only now being formulated in IBM’s advanced labs.”<br><br>Stratus plating platform for 300mm lead-free packaging was qualified to use with IBM’s product family, including high-end and low-end servers and a wide range of custom logic products. The new IBM-TEL NEXX collaboration is also aimed to develop products which can last up to twenty years with trouble free service.<br><br>The Stratus from TEL NEXX deposits thick metal layers for wafer bumping, redistribution layers, Through-hole Silicon Vias (TSVs), integrated passives, and MEMS. Apollo from TEL NEXX is a high throughput sputtering deposition system for use in bump metallization, redistribution layers, backside metallization, CMOS image sensors, integrated passives, and LEDs. Apollo is also designed for solar panel metallization.<br><br>A bit of news on market estimates for 3D semiconductor ICs: The global 3D semiconductor IC market is expected to grow from $2.21 billion in 2009 to $6.55 billion in 2016 at a CAGR of 16.9% from 2011 to 2016, as per latest study by markets and markets.
