                    Alliance Memory said it has achieved more than 1,000 design registrations in a program begun late last year and is adding new registrations at a rate of more than 100 per month. <br><br>"I'm mindful every day of how our channel partners have contributed to our growth, and our design registration program helps us to give back in several ways. For example, by giving us an early indicator of which of our products are most popular, the program allows us to forecast demand better and plan farther ahead to order wafers and finished goods," said David Bagby, Alliance Memory's president and CEO. "It takes a distributor considerable time and effort to complete a registration submission, but our goal is to make that process pay off, not just with preferential pricing but also by helping us both to serve our customers better."<br><br>Alliance Memory said it follows the Design Registration Best Practices recommended by the Electronic Components Industry Association.<br><br>Alliance Memory sells critical and hard-to-find DRAM and SRAM memory ICs for the communications, computing, consumer electronics, medical, automotive, and industrial markets. The company's product range includes DRAMs and SRAMs with commercial, industrial, and automotive operating temperature ranges and densities from 64Kb to 8Gb.
