                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Dynax Semiconductor Inc. of China has placed its first purchase order for an AIXTRON Close Coupled Showerhead (CCS) CRIUS MOCVD system aimed at production of nitride semiconductor electronic devices. It will be the first system in China dedicated to GaN electronics, as per the release by Aixtron.<br><br>AIXTRON says its system will be used to grow gallium nitride (GaN) and related nitride semiconductor epitaxial layers on silicon carbide and silicon substrates for microwave and power devices.<br><br>After installation and commissioning the system is now ready to produce high quality GaN epi-wafers. “This is an important step for us”, Dr. NaiQian Zhang, President and CEO of Dynax Semiconductors, comments. “High power and high efficiency GaN electronic devices are the key components for next generation power management and data communications. This disruptive technology will help us achieve a sustainable society. The AIXTRON reactor is a proven system for this application".<br><br>Dr. Frank Wischmeyer, Vice President and Program Manager Power Electronics at AIXTRON, says “The Dynax technical team already has extensive experience with AIXTRON’s CCS technology. We are looking forward to supporting the customer with our expertise on accelerating the GaN power device market introduction in China.”<br><br>Compared to conventional silicon devices, GaN electronic devices provide superior performance in high frequency (RF) and power electronic applications in terms of efficiency and power density. Two major challenges however have to be met: due to the strong lattice mismatch between GaN and foreign substrates, GaN has to be grown in a special process. To compete with silicon devices, manufacturing costs have to be as low as possible which requires state-of-the-art MOCVD technology to provide high uniformity and reproducibility.
