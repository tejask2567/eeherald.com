                    TSMC has announced that it has been recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) as the semiconductor sector leader for the second year since 2010, and named to the DJSI World and DJSI Asia Pacific indexes for a twelfth successive year. TSMC showed improvements from the previous year in 19 out of 20 categories, emphasizing the company’s dedication to corporate social responsibility, leadership in adopting international sustainability management standards.<br><br>The DJSI covers corporate performance in the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, and invites the world’s 2,500 largest companies in terms of market capitalization for evaluation on criteria including sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and economic and financial indicators to serve as an important benchmark for global investors. This year, 340 corporations were selected as DJSI World Index components, including five semiconductor companies. Of the five companies in the semiconductor sector, TSMC scored highest in categories including Risk and Crisis Management, Supply Chain Management, Environmental Policy/Management System, Product Stewardship, Water-Related Risk, Human Capital Development, Labor Practice Indicators and Human Rights, and Stakeholder Engagement. TSMC also received the highest overall score in the Social Dimension, achieving the highest total score to become the semiconductor sector leader.<br><br>“TSMC aspires to be a pioneer in corporate sustainability,” said TSMC Senior Vice President and Spokesperson Ms. Lora Ho. “In addition to excellent operational performance, we seek innovation in strategy, marketing, management, technology, and manufacturing and also actively adopt forward-looking measures to protect the environment, from green factories to green supply chain. We continue to build world-class green capabilities, strive to improve employee welfare and talent development and carry out our corporate social responsibilities to serve as an important force to uplift society.”<br><br>For more information: www.sustainability-index.com<br><br>Source: TSMC
