                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    <br>VLSI chip design software vendor NanGate has released its V5 Library Creator Platform for advanced process node SoC design, including support for 20/22nm semiconductor process technology. Library Creator to be demonstrated at Booth #1214 with Si2 at the Design Automation Conference which will be held June 4-7 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA.<br><br>Key features of this platform:<br>1. Enables semiconductor chip designers of digital CMOS ICs to custom-tailor cell libraries and explore the impact of alternate device models, design rules and cell architectures.<br><br>2. V5 platform adds support for advanced 20nm process node layout requirements from early adopters, and improves cell creation efficiency by 2.5~7X over previous methodologies, as measured by average cells-per-day.<br><br>3. Facilitates converting VLSI design layouts in the same process node from one architecture to another or from one process node to another node.<br><br>4. For process migration, layouts may change quite significantly. To enable migration automation, Library Creator formulates an abstract representation stripped of process dependent information, which can then be converted to the target process technology with compliance to the latest foundry design rules. The new routing and compaction technology, together with other major enhancements made, enabled the V5 platform's support of 20/22nm requirements. These include: transistor ordering to minimize cell area and congestion, context sensitive spacing and enclosure rules, port rule analysis for enhanced routability, preferred shape pattern selection, multiple patterning(coloring) and use of local interconnect, resulting in a sign-off quality and DFM-friendly cell migration, explains Nangate.<br><br>5. Chip designer can configure layout-dependent effects (LDE) minimization weights to reduce the impact of well proximity, shallow-trench isolation stress, and other layout dependent effects that negatively impact device reliability and performance.<br><br>6. V5 Library Creator supports Si2 OpenAccess database integration module to streamline the export of digital library data to external layout tools.<br><br>"The value of NanGate's Library Creator lies in automating the complex custom design process of cell library creation or process migration, while non-disruptively integrating with existing ASIC EDA environments via standard interfaces such as Si2's OpenAccess database. By automating the time consuming process, designers can more rapidly adopt advanced process technologies, "said George Kuo, Vice President of Marketing and Product Enablement at NanGate. " We have heard great feedback from our tier-1 customers on the effectiveness of our existing platform. We are confident that the V5 Library Creator platform will deliver dramatically improved design team productivity."<br><br>NanGate provides chip design software and IP to semiconductor industry to achieve maximum performance and reduce power with lesser silicon area. NanGate's solutions includes Library Creation Platform, Nangate Design Optimizer, and professional services.<br><br>To learn more visit www.nangate.com
