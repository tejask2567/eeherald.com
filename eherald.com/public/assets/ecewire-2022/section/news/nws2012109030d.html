                    <p>
                    Ericsson has announced the acquisition of the Canadian company ConceptWave in an all cash transaction. Ericsson says strengthens and complements its offering in the area of operations- and business support systems (OSS/BSS) by acquiring ConceptWave. The Order Management and Product Catalog solutions support network operators with their handling of activities related to personalizing end-user offerings and revenue management solutions.<br><br>Elisabetta Romano, Head of OSS in Business Unit Support Solutions, Ericsson, says: "There is a trend towards more personalization of services where end-users want to purchase communications services meeting their individual needs. This puts high demand on telecom operators to be able to offer flexible product bundles with customized pricing packages. In this area ConceptWave's solutions and employees' expertise adds considerable value to Ericsson's portfolio."<br><br>Zarar Rana, President and CEO of ConceptWave, says: "Our products and solutions help maximize telecom operators' assets through the creation, implementation and automation of service fulfillment processes for new and differentiated offerings. Joining Ericsson today adds great value to ConceptWave, as we become part of their global organization and leverage their industry-leading technology and services competence."
