                    <p>
                    IHS has reported shipments of gray market cellphones are set to amount to 210 million units in 2012, representing 13 percent of the global mobile handset business. However this is down from the peak year of 2011, when gray market totaled 250 million units, shipments are set to remain high, amounting to 189 million units, or 11 percent of the global cellphone shipments in 2013, as per IHS.<br><br>IHS explains Gray-market handsets are cell phones manufactured in China that are not recognized or licensed by government regulators. Makers of these products generally do not pay China's value-added taxes and, therefore, profit illegally from their participation in the market.<br><br>Gray market phone are also driving the market for low cost flash memory cards, as per IHS.
