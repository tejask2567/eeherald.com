                    CSR plc has announced the opening of the CSR automotive systems development and applications centre in Ingolstadt, southern Germany. CSR acquired the facility, which was built by TEMIC (Telefunken Hochfrequenztechnik GmbH) as part of its merger with Zoran Corporation last year. The Ingolstadt facility is centrally located next to major European automotive development centres and can serve as regional development, test and validation centre for CSR automotive technologies.<br>"The Ingolstadt automotive centre has been specifically designed, built and staffed with very experienced engineers targeting the automotive market," said Charlie Lesko, senior vice president for CSR's automotive business group. "CSR has been committed to the automotive market over a decade by offering our industry-leading connectivity, location, telematics and infotainment solutions. The investment in this facility is a strong indication of CSR's ongoing commitment to this business and is a key part of our growth strategy. The facility and staff will enable us to offer local support as well as unique services to our automotive customers in Europe."<br>The experienced RF, hardware and software engineering team based at the new facility will allow CSR to expand support and access for German and European customers to the entire CSR automotive product portfolio including location, connectivity and infotainment SoC solutions. The facility will be the in-vehicle test and validation centre for all CSR automotive technologies.<br>"I am delighted to join CSR's automotive business group and for our facility to be at the centre of our new growth strategy in this exciting space," said Andreas Hennig, site manager for CSR's new facility. "The Ingolstadt team is fully committed to deploying our extensive skills and automotive experience to further build on CSR's success in the automotive sector."
