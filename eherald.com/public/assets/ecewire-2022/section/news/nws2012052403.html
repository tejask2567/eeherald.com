                  <p class="title-text"> Mindspeed' Transcede SoC powered Small cell reference design supports Trillium software </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Radisys Corporation and Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. have announced that the companies will showcase an eNodeB small cell reference design supporting the latest Trillium TOTALeNodeB software on the Mindspeed Transcede platform at the LTE world summit. Radisys and Mindspeed are also continuing to collaborate to provide dual-mode System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms that support both LTE and 3G.<br><br>As LTE rolls out, operators will still need to support a mixed subscriber base for both 3G and LTE services, and will therefore need to provide both technologies during the migration. Dual-mode small cells enable operators to serve their mixed 3G and LTE customers while reducing backhaul bandwidth costs, site acquisition costs and the cost of the infrastructure itself rather than deploying separate systems. The Mindspeed and Radisys solution will support carrier aggregation, giving operators the option to "re-farm" 3G spectrum and also use it for additional LTE, all by simply updating the small cell software.<br><br>Mindspeed's latest additions to its Transcede family of processors leverage Radisys Trillium software and are complete NodeB and eNodeB SoC solutions that support concurrent 3G and LTE processing in a single device, including TD-SCDMA, wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), evolved high-speed packet access (HSPA+) and both frequency division duplexing LTE (FDD-LTE) and time-division duplex long-term evolution (TDD-LTE), with a roadmap to LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). 3G and LTE processing capabilities combined with carrier-class, physical-layer (PHY) software on a single chip accelerates time to market, while simplifying development and reducing risk.<br><br>"The Transcede T2200/3300 dual-mode processors are already sampling to customers. We have LTE running and are now porting over the industry-leading 3G baseband we acquired with Picochip," said Dr. Naser Adas, vice president and general manager, wireless, Mindspeed. "For us, both LTE and 3G are already well-established and integrated with Radisys' Trillium protocol stacks. We are now bringing them together onto one single platform. Given the field-proven maturity of both modes and the strong history between our two companies, we are confident that we will lead the industry in shipping carrier-class dual-mode solutions into operator deployments."<br><br>Radisys Trillium wireless software provides complete 3G and LTE base station capabilities. Trillium software provides equipment manufacturers with a complete, integrated LTE eNodeB and 3G NodeB including radio resource management (RRM), radio environment monitoring (REM), self-organizing network (SON), schedulers and all of the Trillium protocols stacks.<br><br>"Our strong relationship with Mindspeed demonstrates our position as the go-to software provider for this ecosystem and emphasizes our dedication to delivering the high quality, high performance software our partners need," said Amit Agarwal, vice president and general manager, software solutions group, Radisys. "Our commitment to ongoing support of the Mindspeed Transcede product line and focus on delivering joint, multi-mode products places our customers at the forefront of the market. At LTE World Summit we are showing a glimpse of the small cell solutions being deployed by our various customers and a view into the future of the innovative solutions expected as a result of this collaboration."<br><br>"When two strong innovators such as Radisys and Mindspeed join efforts, they enable an entire ecosystem of cutting edge wireless infrastructure components," said Khurram Sheikh, chief product and development officer, Powerwave Technologies, Inc., a global leader in end-to-end wireless coverage and capacity solutions for wireless communications networks. "We are taking advantage of this partnership to deliver the resulting products to help our diverse customer base migrate to LTE with ease and flexibility."
