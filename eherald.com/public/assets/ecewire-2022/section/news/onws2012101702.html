                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    CEVA, Inc. and NXP Software have announced the companies have partnered to deliver an enhanced HD voice processing solution for the smartphone market, integrating NXP Software's LifeVibes VoiceExperience software with the CEVA-TeakLite family of DSPs, including the CEVA-TeakLite-4.<br><br>Through the partnership, NXP Software has ported and optimized its technologies in speakerphone and multi-microphone noise suppression, acoustic echo cancellation and voice quality, onto the DSP platform, which has powered audio/voice processing in more than 2 billion devices to date. The fully optimized solution, running on the CEVA-TeakLite-III DSP, is already deployed with a major handset OEM for their smartphones product lines.<br><br>For the dozens of CEVA customers using the CEVA-TeakLite DSP family for audio and voice processing in their mobile device system-on-chips (SoCs), the CEVA-specific implementation of NXP Software's VoiceExperience enables them to easily add HD quality voice processing technology into their existing designs. For licensees of the CEVA-TeakLite-III and CEVA-TeakLite-4 DSPs, the VoiceExperience algorithms can further bind the low power, native 32-bit, voice capabilities to achieve better voice clarity and extended battery life.<br><br>"There is a clear trend towards enhanced voice quality in smartphones today, combining advanced hardware and software techniques, including voice pre-processing and new multi-microphone configurations to reduce background noise and improve voice clarity," said Nicolas Sauvage, Director of Marketing and Sales at NXP Software. "The CEVA-TeakLite-4 DSP delivers outstanding performance for these demanding applications, allowing our customers to gain maximum benefit from our VoiceExperience software package, and at lower power consumption."<br><br>"We are pleased to collaborate with NXP Software, a world renowned provider of advanced voice applications. Our CEVA-TeakLite DSP family has become the industry standard for advanced audio and voice SoC solutions thanks in part to the large, robust partner ecosystem providing support for such advanced audio and voice applications," said Eran Briman, vice president of marketing at CEVA. "With the LifeVibes VoiceExperience software optimized for our latest CEVA-TeakLite-4 DSP, we have significantly enhanced the HD voice processing capabilities available to product developers today."<br><br>Deployed in more than one billion devices, LifeVibes products provide rapid time-to-market and measurably superior quality, backed by global support. VoiceExperience enables natural, comfortable communication over phone networks and IP-based channels such as Skype and Google Talk. It improves the intelligibility of speech, avoids echo and distortion, and reduces stationary and non-stationary background noise (such as traffic or crowds). VoiceExperience uses the same engine for voice calls, video telephony and VoIP, and is HD Voice compatible. Its HD voice compatibility ensures the voice sounds clear and natural, with improved intelligibility on all types of phone and mobile devices.<br><br>The CEVA-TeakLite DSP family has more than 2.5 billion chips shipped, over 100 licensees, 25 active ecosystem partners and more than 100 audio and voice codecs and enhancement applications available.<br><br>To learn more: http://www.ceva-dsp.com/CEVA-TeakLite-Family.html<br><br>Source: CEVA
