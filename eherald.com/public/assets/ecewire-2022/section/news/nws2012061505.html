"He has shaped Micrel's new product development direction while building a metric-driven organization. In addition, Rami has been instrumental in expanding High Bandwidth division's market reach and integrating the PhaseLink team and technology into the Micrel family. I am confident that under the new leadership we have put in place for our High Bandwidth group, we will see even more vigorous growth for these key products.We look forward to more contributions from both executives," concluded Ray Zinn.<br><br>Mr. Kanama has more than 18 years of experience in high tech management. He has served as Micrel's Director of High Bandwidth Marketing since 2008, and as vice president of Clock and Timing Products since April 2012, with responsibility for the division's business development, strategic and product marketing. During this period, Mr. Kanama reorganized the group to be more market and customer focused, launched key Fiber Optics products and created a new clock and timing business unit by introducing the industry's best performance clock synthesizers (Clockworks).
