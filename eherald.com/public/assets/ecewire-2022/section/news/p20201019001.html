                  <p class="title-text"> Nokia employs Qualcomm' 5G RAN in its 5G Smart Node </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Nokia-made Smart Node portfolio of All-in-One base stations for  indoor use are powered by Qualcomm' chipsets. The new 5G Smart Node is said to complement its other similar commercially deployed products such as AirScale Micro Remote Radio Head and AirScale Indoor Radio. Smart Node is expected to be available from Q1 2021.<br><br>Nokia using Qualcomm chips to make its 5G base station products more compact, less space consuming, cost-effective, and plug-and-play package for smaller indoor network use-cases. <br><br>Nokia 5G Smart Node allows network operators to address 5G network densification and indoor coverage requirements such as in-home, small office and enterprise coverage.<br><br>Due to significantly heavy usage of mobile sessions inside the home and small businesses, it is essential for 5G network providers to provide good quality indoor 5G coverage. Having 5G stations indoor saves the signal from propagation losses where they don’t need to pass through  buildings and other obstacles. 5G Smart Nodes are designed for a minimal overheads and simple installation.<br><br>Smart Nodes are modular and flexible so that they can be upgraded from 4G to 5G, and can be mounted on table-tops or fixed on walls or ceilings.  Qualcomm's FSM100xx software defined small cell modem simplifies moving to newer network standards. Other features integrated include narrowband IoT support for low-power, wide-area coverage, emergency helpline services, local break out and telecom grade security help operators address indoor network needs just like in outdoor base station but are simplified.<br><br>Durga Malladi, senior vice president and general manager, 4G/5G, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., said, "We are delighted to be joining forces with Nokia to bring our industry-leading 5G RAN innovations to a wider array of use-cases and settings. The flexibility and low-price points of 5G Smart Node products resulting from our close engagement with the team at Nokia will help accelerate the adoption of 5G in the residential and small office markets."<br><br>Tommi Uitto, president, mobile networks, Nokia, said, "We are proud to be working with Qualcomm Technologies to utilize its chipset technology in our 5G Smart Node solutions. The 5G small cells arena is an area we are delivering unmatched innovation and working with Qualcomm Technologies is a testament to our mission to bring everyone into the world of 5G. We look forward to continue working with Qualcomm Technologies and leading the charge to 5G."
