                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    A*STAR Institute of Microelectronics (IME) announces a collaboration with Rolls-Royce for the research and development of advanced power electronics devices.<br><br>This research collaboration aims to use gallium nitrite (GaN) power devices for the development of high-power-density converters that can reliably measure various physical parameters at soaring temperatures of up to 300°C and at environmental pressure of up to 30kpsi. This collaboration will be delivered through IME’s Rugged Electronics programme, which was set up to support Singapore’s drive to become a technology hub for the aerospace, oil and gas sectors. The focus of IME’s Rugged Electronics programme is to develop a wide range of solutions from sensing, packaging, telemetry, non-volatile memory to integrated circuits<br><br>“This collaboration leverages IME’s established competence and enables us to extend our research to innovate in new industries,” commented Professor Dim-Lee Kwong, Executive Director of IME. “More importantly, this strategic partnership offers an excellent opportunity for Singapore to build knowledge in this industry and move further up the value chain.”<br><br>“We are excited to work with IME in the research and development of advanced power electronics systems and high temperature electronics. IME’s expertise, flexibility and positive approach makes them an excellent research partner,” said Dr Kurichi Kumar, Director of Research & Technology - Asia, Rolls-Royce Singapore.
