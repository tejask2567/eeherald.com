                  <p class="title-text"> Two billionth sensor devices shipped by Infineon </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Infineon Technologies AG has announced it has shipped its two billionth sensor and thus becomes a leading provider of semiconductor-based magnetic sensors and pressure sensors. Infineon provides pressure sensors for use in side airbag systems, magnetic sensors for wheel speed measurement in anti-lock braking systems, etc.<br><br>Infineon claims that they deliver around four out of the some 20 magnetic and pressure sensors deployed on average in every new vehicle. This figure does not even include sensors used for tire pressure monitoring. The supplier also claims that their sensor chips are represented in virtually all of the estimated 80 sensor applications in a vehicle, e.g. in safety, in the powertrain as well as in the body and convenience electronics. The company's magnetic sensors are used for example in the electronic power steering, the gearbox control and in convenience functions such as electric windows. Its pressure sensors, which incorporate the latest side airbag standards PSI5 and AK-LV 29, are used above all in side airbags and in the engine management system, not to mention in emerging applications such as pedestrian protection.<br><br>"One of our key areas in sensor innovation is the combination of the sensing element with signal processing on one piece of silicon, thus making our sensors increasingly more reliable," said Frank Findeis, marketing director, Integrated Sensors at Infineon Technologies AG. "In conjunction with our wealth of experience and high level of quality, this makes us the sensor partner of choice for automotive and industrial electronics."<br><br>Infineon delivers sensor products both in the wafer-level silicon technology as well as the sensing elements. They have magnetic sensors, besides the Hall effect technology, magneto-resistive technologies which include GMR (giant magneto-resistive resistance), AMR (anisotropic magneto resistance) and TMR (tunnelling magneto resistance) technologies.<br><br>"Mastering the use of nickel-iron alloys, for example, in the manufacturing process of the integrated sensors, equates in fact to a small technological revolution similar to the introduction of copper metallization in the semiconductor manufacturing process," said Frank Findeis. "The fact that we have succeeded here with our sensors is testimony of Infineon's exceptional innovative energy."
