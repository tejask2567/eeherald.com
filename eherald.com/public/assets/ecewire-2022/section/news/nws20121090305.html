                    <p>
                    SEMI’s August Book-to-Bill report mentions that North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment posted $1.12 billion in orders globally in August 2012 (three-month average basis) and a book-to-bill ratio of 0.84. A book-to-bill of 0.84 means that $84 worth of orders were received for every $100 of product billed for the month.<br><br>According to SEMI:<br>The three-month average of worldwide bookings in August 2012 was $1.12 billion. The bookings figure is 9.2 percent lower than the revised July 2012 level of $1.23 billion, and is 3.6 percent lower than the August 2011 order level of $1.16 billion.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide billings in August 2012 was $1.34 billion. The billings figure is 7.4 percent lower than the revised July 2012 level of $1.44 billion, and is 8.4 percent less than the August 2011 billings level of $1.46 billion.<br><br>"The second half of the year continues to show reduced order and billing levels for the 2012 spending cycle," said Dan Tracy, senior director of SEMI Industry Research and Statistics. "We expect 2012 equipment revenues to decline slightly with total spending for front-end and back-end semiconductor equipment globally remaining at the $40 billion or greater level for the third consecutive year."<br><br>The SEMI book-to-bill is a ratio of three-month moving averages of worldwide bookings and billings for North American-based semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Billings and bookings figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.<br><br>Source :SEMI
