                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Synopsys announced that it has acquired Moortec, a leading provider of in-chip monitoring technology specializing in process, voltage and temperature (PVT) sensors. The amount of the deal is not disclosed.<br><br>Synopsys says  "The Moortec sensors provide a key component to Synopsys' new Silicon Lifecycle Management (SLM) platform. Data from these environmental sensors is critical to properly understanding chip performance activity and will enable the SLM platform's analytics engines to drive more detailed and precise optimizations at each stage of the semiconductor lifecycle, starting with design implementation, and progressing through manufacturing, production test, bring-up and culminating with in-field operation."<br><br>"We continue to deliver on our roadmap of innovation to provide silicon lifecycle optimization solutions that address the evolving needs of the dynamic semiconductor industry," said Sassine Ghazi, chief operating officer of Synopsys. "This acquisition accelerates the expansion of our SLM platform by providing our customers with a comprehensive data-analytics-driven solution for devices at the most advanced process nodes."<br><br>At deep nodes of semiconductor manufacturing, the physical and functional conditions are extremely variable inside the chip, so it demands in-chip monitoring for mission critical management. Synopsys says Moortec brings to it the industry's most advanced and comprehensive range of in-chip PVT sensors and control subsystems.   Most of the world's biggest semiconductor fabs are already using Moortec's technology in 100s of chip designs on process nodes down to 5nm.
