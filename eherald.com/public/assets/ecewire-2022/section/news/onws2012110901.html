Amalfi's proprietary RF and mixed-signal expertise in RF CMOS are a great fit for RFMD and a strong addition to our long-term technology strategy. RFMD gives Amalfi the global presence, market credibility, manufacturing scale, and blue--chip customer access to take their business to the next phase of growth."<br><br>Mark Foley, CEO and president of Amalfi, said, "The addition of Amalfi's RF CMOS PA technology with RFMD's market leadership and significant resources is a powerful combination. We expect the acquisition will accelerate the delivery of new disruptive RF CMOS power amplifiers to the cost-driven entry-level smartphone market. We are excited to be part of the RFMD team."<br>Under the terms of the agreement, RFMD will acquire Amalfi with cash on hand for total consideration of approximately $47.5 million, net of cash received.
