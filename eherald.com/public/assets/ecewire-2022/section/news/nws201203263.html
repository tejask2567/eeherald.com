                    In-Stat rates wireless home digital interface (WHDI), WirelessHD, and Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) as the three top technologies for Consumer Electronics (CE) interface and WiGig/802.11ad is expected to have the most long-term success, as per In-Stat. In-Stat research forecasts WiGig/802.11ad-enabled PC device shipments will approach 15 million units in 2015.<br><br>"WiGig has both drawbacks and advantages in comparison with the competition," says Brian O'Rourke, Research Director. "Its major drawback is that it is not yet available, while WHDI and WirelessHD have been on the market for years. Its advantages include the fact that it is slated to become the 60GHz WLAN specification?IEEE 802.11ad?and three chip vendors will be coming to market in the next year with WiGig/802.11ad silicon. In addition, the WiGig Alliance includes in its membership multiple WLAN silicon vendors and a diverse assortment of major technology companies including Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Samsung, Nokia, and Broadcom."<br><br>Report findings include the following:<br>Desktops, standard notebooks, and mini-notes (netbooks) are unlikely to adopt the technology over the length of the forecast period, primarily for reasons of cost.<br>Expect to see experimentation in tablet PCs with various technologies over the next few years, but WiGig/802.11ad will be the eventual winner, because it is a Wi-Fi standard.<br>The strength for wireless HD video technologies in CE is in connecting mobile devices, including smartphones, to large-screen devices in order to display HD video on the larger screen.<br>Wi-Fi Display will emerge as a significant competitor to all three wireless HD video technologies.
