                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Quantance has said it has send samples of its third-generation chip, the Q845 ET power supply, to several major players in the LTE supply chain, including baseband/transceiver chipset providers and handset OEMs. The Q845 chip from Quantance is said to enable power amplifier (PA) efficiency to reach theoretical limits and increase PA transmit power.<br><br>The Q845 uses a patented combination of switching and linear power supplies inside a single 0.18um CMOS chip to efficiently deliver precisely controlled voltage to the PA. The Q845 supports ET operation up to 20MHz LTE, providing the response time equivalent of a 400MHz switcher for ET systems. As a result, the Q845 is more than 100 times faster than any other mobile ET power supply solution available today, claims Quantence.<br><br>“We are thrilled to be sampling our chip and are already deep in the process of integrating our qBoostenabled products into baseband chipset platforms and high-speed mobile data devices,” said Vikas Vinayak, Quantance’s CEO and co-founder. “The industrywide interest in our chip is a strong indicator that the 4G/LTE market will depend heavily on ET to achieve maximum speed, coverage and battery life. And with our unique qBoost approach, we feel Quantance is well positioned to lead the ET market race.”
