                  <p class="title-text"> CSR acquires MAP-X audio product line from Trident </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    CSR has announced that it has completed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the MAP-X audio product line from Trident Microsystems, Inc. CSR says this acquisition will allow CSR to build on its existing end-to-end audio platform enabling customers to more easily develop high performance home audio consumer electronics products.<br><br>The MAP-X processor is designed to deliver HD audio decoding and internet audio streaming for next generation home audio, AV receivers, and soundbars. Integration of the MAP-X technology into soundbars and network speakers is expected to improve the sound quality currently delivered by integrated TV speakers.<br><br>"In today's marketplace TVs are getting thinner and visual quality is delivered in High Definition at ever improving levels of quality and richness, but audio from integrated TV speakers cannot keep pace," said Anthony Murray, SVP Home Business Group of CSR. "Coupled with this, consumer expectations are on the rise and individuals are demanding high definition, more immersive audio to match the high quality visual experience."<br><br>He continues, "Soundbars with wireless sub woofers and wireless active speakers that accompany TVs can deliver the audio quality consumers demand. By combining MAP-X's prowess in high performance multimedia processing with CSR's leadership position in wireless audio platforms, we aim to provide a much richer consumer experience."<br><br>"In addition, consumers will gain the added benefit of being able to wirelessly stream their entire music collection from a smartphone or tablet to a high quality home audio system, like a soundbar. We believe bringing MAP-X into our existing product portfolio can now offer a unique audio technology platform that addresses the entire market for home audio products with the added freedom of wireless," he added
