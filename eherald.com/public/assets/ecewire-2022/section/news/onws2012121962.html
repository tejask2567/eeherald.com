                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    IT and technology market researcher Gartner has predicted social networking, mobile communications, the cloud and information are pressuring enterprises worldwide to make fundamental changes in business processes and that industry decision-makers should use Gartner's predictions to understand and respond to this Nexus of Forces.<br><br>Most industries will face massive changes during the period from 2013 through 2015. These changes will force fundamental shifts in business processes that will, in turn, further reshape those industries, according to Kimberly Harris-Ferrante, vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner. She finds Social commons, mobile communications, cloud computing and information are important factors in driving even greater industry transformation, challenging existing business models and processes and opening up greater competitive and other threats.<br><br>The forecast/predictions shared by Gartner for IT software/systems industry includes:<br><br>Automotive: By 2016, three automakers will have announced concrete plans for upcoming automobile launches that will offer autonomous vehicle technology.<br><br>New economy: By 2015, nontraditional money creation and exchange will enable 125 million more people to participate in the mainstream global economy.<br><br>Healthcare: By 2016, patients will be harmed or placed at risk by a medical device security breach. By 2015, natural-language processing (NLP) use among large healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) in English-speaking countries will quintuple, fueled by documentation, coding, quality reporting and research.<br><br>e-Education: By 2016, national governments will require institutions to surrender student records for a redesigned, cost-cutting curriculum based on big data analysis.<br><br>Factory IT: By 2015, to avoid becoming simply transaction factories, successful payer organizations will turn to information integration as their competitive differentiator.<br><br>Utility Systems: By 2016, half of U.S. utility customers will have access to standardized energy usage data, but only 20 percent will use it.<br><br>Insurance: By year end 2014, pay-as-you-drive insurance will rise significantly to account for 10 percent of overall annual auto insurance premiums.<br><br>Advertising: By 2017, more than 50 percent of the media sold to advertisers by agencies will be priced based on performance.<br><br>Security and ID: By 2014, less than 2 percent of consumers globally will adopt Near Field Communication (NFC)-based mobile payments.<br><br>Cloud Computing: More than 50 percent of government shared-service organizations that provide cloud services by 2015 will discontinue or downscale them by 2017.<br><br>E-commerce: By 2015, 50 percent of Tier 1 consumer goods manufacturers will invest in technology startups to maintain access to emerging business-to-consumer (B2C) technology.<br><br>Enterprise software: Through 2014 enterprise software spend will increase by 25 percent from current figures as a consequence of the proliferation of smart operational technology (OT).<br><br>Manufacturing: By 2016, at least 25 percent of discrete manufacturers will adopt 3D printing to produce parts for products they sell or service.<br><br>Pervasiveness of social networking and the mobile-device-driven consumerization of IT are going to be felt across virtually all industries, according to Ms. Harris-Ferrante. She finds increasing reliance on cloud computing and other 'open' IT delivery models, are going to be industry-specific. Enterprise IT and business decision-makers with an extraordinarily difficult set of choices in the years to come, she predicts.<br><br>Most of the prediction are quite good except on the role of Govt in cloud computing. Cloud computing is going to be kind of utility where ordinary person going to utilize for his daily IT needs.
