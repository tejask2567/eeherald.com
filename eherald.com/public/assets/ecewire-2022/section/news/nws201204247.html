                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Microsemi Corporation has shipped its 10,000th radiation-tolerant RTAX-S FPGA device for flight-critical applications. Microsemi has also shipped tens of thousands of its previous generation spaceflight FPGAs. For the past 55 years, Microsemi has developed products for use in space systems orbiting the Earth, moon, Mars, Venus and sun, and for equipment used in missions to the surface of Mars, the Eros asteroid, and into the furthest reaches of the solar system.<br><br>Microsemi's space heritage began in 1957 when its micro-positioner relay was launched in the Atlas rocket. The company's space technology was deployed in space missions such as the Surveyor, Apollo, Saturn, Mars rovers, Cygnus spacecraft initiatives, etc,<br><br>"Our radiation-tolerant RTAX-S/SL FPGAs for space-flight applications continue our heritage of providing an alternative to costly and inflexible ASICs, and have since become the industry standard for performance, power efficiency and reliability," said James J. Peterson, Microsemi's president and chief executive officer. "This milestone is one of many that have punctuated our more than half century of commitment to space innovation, as demonstrated through our integral role in hundreds of missions and development programs around the world."<br><br>Microsemi's portfolio of radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant space products includes FPGAs, ASICs, RF components, diodes, transistors, MOSFETS, hybrids, power supplies, custom semiconductor packaging and integrated power distribution systems. The products are qualified to the highest government, DLA, NASA and ESA standards.<br><br>Space parts working group event<br>Jim Aralis, Microsemi's chief technology officer, will provide an overview of the company's space solutions portfolio and accomplishments at the 42nd annual space parts working group (SPWG) event. The annual SPWG event is an unclassified, international forum for disseminating information to the aerospace industry and for resolving problems with high-reliability electronic piece parts for space applications.<br><br>Microsemi space forums<br>Microsemi brings together its partners and global space customers to focus on topics relevant to the space industry, including trends, testing and qualification of space-flight FPGAs, future products, user case studies, software and core updates, and packaging roadmaps. The next event is scheduled for December 4, 2012, in Los Angeles, Calif.<br><br>Microsemi's FPGA space milestones include:<br><br>1. 1996: radiation-hardened, non-volatile FPGA<br>2. 2001: radiation-tolerant FPGAs specifically architected to address single-event upsets (SEUs) in space<br>3. 2008: radiation-tolerant MIL-STD-883 class B-qualified FPGAs for space-flight applications using flash-based process technology<br>4. 2010: MIL-STD-883 class B qualification of the FPGAs for space applications to feature radiation-tolerant hardwired multiply accumulate blocks
