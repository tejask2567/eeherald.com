                    <p>
                    Cavium has announced that it is an architecture licensee for the ARMv8 architecture. The ARMv8 architecture features 64-bit execution, enabling processors based on the architecture to be able to combine 64-bit execution with 32-bit execution. Cavium says one of the key focuses in developing this version of the ARM instruction set was to bring the energy-efficient heritage of ARM processor technology to 64-bit computing.<br><br>“We are delighted to extend this relationship as we broaden the range of ARM processor-based applications. Cavium is a leading multicore processor vendor and has delivered highly differentiated SoCs including a range of ARM processor-based products for many years,” said Warren East, CEO ARM. “With this architecture license, Cavium will bring innovation through highly optimized 64-bit custom cores and SoC implementations to deliver disruptive solutions for the cloud and datacenter market.”<br><br>“Cavium will leverage its extensive experience and IP in high-performance multicore processors and software to address the new requirements in the cloud and datacenter market,” said Syed Ali, President and CEO, Cavium. “The adoption of the ARMv8 architecture combined with ARM’s extensive software ecosystem will enable us to extend the reach of our innovative, high performance multicore SoCs to new customers and applications.”
