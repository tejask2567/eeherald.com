                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Mindspeed Technologies, Inc has announced that it will form a joint development lab with China Mobile Communications Corporation to support the operator's recent deployment of Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA) femtocells.<br><br>"With the close support and collaboration from chip vendors and infrastructure companies like Mindspeed, femtocell technologies in China Mobile's TD-SCDMA network have achieved commercial deployment. This joint development brings a significantly improved customer experience and further demonstrates that small cells will play important roles in wireless broadband services," said Gu Yihong, assistant general manager at China Mobile Jiangsu Suzhou Branch. "The convergence of TD-SCDMA, TDD-LTE, GSM and Wi-Fi is a fast evolving technology trend, and we appreciate TD-Femto ecosystem companies like Mindspeed that are driving this shift with mature solutions."<br><br>"Mindspeed is delighted that China Mobile is deploying TD-SCDMA femtocell solutions in Suzhou using our technology," said Raouf Y. Halim, chief executive officer at Mindspeed. "We believe an enhanced collaboration with the world's leading operator in the TD-SCDMA/TD-LTE area will allow Mindspeed to deliver the best performance on next generation small cell solutions."<br><br>Mindspeed's Transcede family of processors are complete NodeB and eNodeB system on chip solutions that support concurrent 3G and long-term evolution (LTE) processing in a single device, including TD-SCDMA, wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), evolved high-speed packet access (HSPA+) and both frequency division duplexing LTE (FDD-LTE) and time-division duplex long-term evolution (TDD-LTE) with a roadmap to LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). Combining 3G and LTE processing capabilities into a single chip is more cost effective for OEMs and the inclusion of a carrier-class physical-layer (PHY) software solution for both 3G and LTE will accelerate time to market, while simplifying development and reducing risk.
