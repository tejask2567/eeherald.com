                    <p>
                    Bangalore based VLSI company Cosmic Circuits has announced winners of its popular analog circuit design contest Nebula 2012. The winner are:<br><br>1st	Girish Ramakrishnan	IIT, Madras<br>2nd	Venkatraman Natarajan	College of Engineering, Guindy<br>3rd	Subramanian T R	IISc, Bangalore<br><br>The contest is quite popular among the engineering colleges in India. This year there were 2000 contestants, double compared to 2011. The contest has three stages/rounds. Candidates enter 2nd round after objective type 1st round, which is conducted online. The 2nd and 3rd round is about real design challenges faced by VLSI designers in designing semiconductor chips for the future electronics products.<br><br>Cracking analog circuit design problems need lot of creativity along with knowledge of analog circuit theory. Its linear world influenced by every factor in the environment. Event like Nebula provides a platform to sharpen the skills and knowledge for the real world 'analog VLSI design career'.<br><br>Cosmic has developed range of semiconductor IPs in the analog and mixed signal domain and is also making chips. Cosmic is a hope in India’s dull domestic chip industry.<br><br>To know more about Cosmic visit http://cosmiccircuits.com
