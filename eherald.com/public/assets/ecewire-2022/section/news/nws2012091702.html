                    <p>
                    AudioCodes has announced that its 300HD and 400HD IP Phone products are being tested for compatibility with Microsoft Lync and the qualification is expected to be completed by the end of the year 2012.<br><br>Microsoft tests and qualifies third party phones for interoperability and basic quality of experience with Microsoft Lync 2010.<br><br>Enhanced voice call quality and clarity for the Enterprise IP telephony markets is presented by the AudioCodes 300HD and 400HD series of high definition IP phones. These IP phones enable value added resellers (VARs), system integrators and end-customers to build end-to-end Unified Communications solutions with Microsoft Lync 2010.<br><br>Upon qualification, AudioCodes plans to present a free firmware upgrade for those customers with existing 300HD and 400HD series phones, enabling direct integration of those devices to Microsoft Lync 2010.<br><br>"We see the qualification of AudioCodes 300HD and 400HD IP Phones with Microsoft Lync as highly valuable to our partner community," said Lior Aldema, Chief Operating Officer of AudioCodes. "Sourcing gateways, E-SBCs, IP Phones and professional services from the same vendor simplifies the purchasing, deployment and support processes, effectively reducing costs for our partners."<br><br>"We’re pleased to welcome AudioCodes and their 300HD and 400HD IP phones to our phone interoperability program," said Jyoti Black, Senior Director, Microsoft. "Once AudioCodes IP phones are qualified, partners can benefit from simplifying purchase, training, and support by procuring phones, gateways, SBAs and E-SBCs from a single vendor."<br> <br>l
