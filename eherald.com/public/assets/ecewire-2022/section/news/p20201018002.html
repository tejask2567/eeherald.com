                    ON Semiconductor is the new member of ZBOSS Open Initiative (ZOI), a group of companies who are working towards having a common Zigbee PRO software platform to address issues of interoperability, security, testing, and optimization of Zigbee-enabled products and solutions.<br><br>The members of ZOI can have access to certified and stable ZBOSS source code, a Zigbee stack source code base, and insight into the implementation details. The member benefits also include the ability to submit "pull" an "new feature development" requests, access to verification testing and results, validate Zigbee Pro platform certifications, binaries use license with their product, and distribute source code passes to their clients.<br><br>"Being a part of the ZOI community opens the door to many great benefits from accessing Zigbee stack source code, to hardware platform enablement, and support from the ecosystem. We can efficiently work with IoT market players to ensure interoperability and significantly reduce development time with the ZBOSS shared platform. Meanwhile, we will continue to innovate low-power, robust, integrated wireless communications devices for the IoT connectivity market," commented Simon Duxbury, vice president and general manager, Wireless Connectivity & Signal Processing Division at ON Semiconductor.<br><br>"We are focused on growing and developing ZOI to contribute real value to the future of the Zigbee Pro offering. We believe that collaboration between market players within the ZOI framework is key to overcoming, together, the common challenges in Zigbee Pro development. The addition of ON Semiconductor to the ZOI community symbolizes further major-market support for our new and unique business model," added Anatoli Pechkov, CEO of DSR Corporation.<br><br>For more information regarding the ZBOSS Open Initiative, including membership details and frequently asked questions, visit https://dsr-zoi.com/
