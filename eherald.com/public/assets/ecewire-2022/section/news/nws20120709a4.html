                    <p>
                    Qualcomm has announced a new leadership structure for its QCT semiconductor business. QCT is comprised of mobile and computing products, connectivity and networking products and related support organizations. Cristiano Amon and Dr. Murthy Renduchintala have been promoted to co-presidents of mobile and computing products, Dr. Craig Barratt will continue as president of connectivity and networking products and Jim Lederer will continue as general manager, leading the business support organizations. All four, who have a long history of leadership and expertise in the mobile space, will report to Steve Mollenkopf, president and chief operating officer of Qualcomm. The changes are effective immediately.<br><br>“I am pleased to congratulate Cristiano and Murthy on their new positions. Their leadership has been instrumental in the business’s success to date and I look forward to working with them in their expanded roles,” Mollenkopf said.<br><br>Amon began his career at Qualcomm in 1995 and most recently served as senior vice president of product management in the Company’s cellular products group. He holds a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. With Qualcomm since 2004, Renduchintala most recently served as senior vice president of engineering and co-led the QCT engineering organization. He holds a Doctoral degree in the field of digital communications and a Master’s degree in business administration from the University of Bradford.
