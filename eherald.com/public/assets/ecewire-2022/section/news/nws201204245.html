                    <p>
                    SEMI published the March Book-to-Bill report that mentioned that North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment posted $1.48 billion in orders in March 2012 and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. A book-to-bill of 1.13 means that $113 worth of orders were received for every $100 of product billed for the month.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide bookings in March 2012 was $1.48 billion. The bookings figure is 10.7 percent higher than the final February 2012 level of $1.34 billion, and is 6.4 percent below the $1.58 billion in orders posted in March 2011.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide billings in March 2012 was $1.31 billion. The billings figure is 0.9 percent less than the final February 2012 level of $1.32 billion, and is 20.9 percent less than the March 2011 billings level of $1.66 billion.<br><br>"Equipment orders continue to increase and have improved to the highest reported value since July 2011," said Denny McGuirk, president and CEO of SEMI. "The semiconductor equipment market outlook has strengthened since the beginning of the year as reflected in the increasing bookings rate."<br><br>The SEMI book-to-bill is a ratio of three-month moving averages of worldwide bookings and billings for North American-based semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Billings and bookings figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.<br> 	Billings (3 month avg)	Bookings (3 month avg)	Book-to-Bill<br>Oct-11	1,258.30	926.8	0.74<br>Nov-11	1,176.70	977.2	0.83<br>Dec-11	1,300.00	1,102.90	0.85<br>Jan-12	1,239.90	1,187.50	0.96<br>Feb 2012 (final)	1,322.80	1,336.90	1.01<br>March 2012 (prelim)	1,310.90	1,479.30	1.13<br>Source: SEMI April 2012<br><br>The data contained in this release were compiled by David Powell, Inc., an independent financial services firm, without audit, from data submitted directly by the participants.
