                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Inphi has announced the 32GB LRDIMM modules from Samsung Electronics, enabled by Inphi’s iMB, doubled server capacity and boosted performance by up to 275%.<br><br>The performance test conducted by Principled Technologies used IBM System x3750 M4 server based on Intel Xeon processor E5-4600. IBM x3750 M4 supports up to 1.5TB of LRDIMM memory operating at 1333 MT/s and 1.35V. The system was configured with the IBM x3750 M4 running multiple virtual machines on VMware vSphere 5 and each instance running Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 containing 50GB of Microsoft SQL Server 2012 database. The benchmark emulated an e-commerce workload and measured “orders per minute.” The x3750 M4 was first configured with 384GB of standard Registered DIMMs, or RDIMMs, to determine overall application performance. The server’s RDIMMs were then replaced by iMB-enabled Samsung LRDIMMs, doubling capacity to 768GB of system memory in the very same slots as the RDIMMs. The system configuration with 12 VMs and 768GB system memory, using 32GB Samsung LRDIMMs, processed 275% more orders per minute as compared with the system configured with 384GB of standard memory.<br><br>“These benchmark results validate LRDIMMs in general and, in particular, what we at Inphi are committed to achieving with our iMB technology,” said Paul Washkewicz, vice president of marketing for Inphi’s Computing and Storage products. “LRDIMM buffers with our iMB technology were able to double capacity and dramatically and boost performance on one of the most advanced server platforms available today. This reflects how systems of all kinds can take advantage of iMB-enabled LRDIMM technology to expand and enhance the performance in the cloud, data centers and multiple other enterprise applications.”
