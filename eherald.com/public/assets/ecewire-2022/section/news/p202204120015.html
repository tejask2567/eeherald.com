                    Active ES pen from Wacom uses Renesas wireless power charging ICs. Renesas claims its products are so small that they can fit into a pen and also operate at higher efficiency compared to alternative high-frequency charging devices. <br><br>Wacom ES pens are growing in the market due to their ability to help users to creatively express themselves on both smartphones and tablets.<br><br>“Renesas is proud to expand our work with a proven leader such as Wacom to help bring leading-edge wireless charging solutions to the digital pen market,” said Amit Bavisi, Vice President and general manager of Renesas’ Wireless Power Group, Mobility Infrastructure and IoT Power Business Division. “We continue to be the innovation leader in wireless charging, working with customers around the world to bring the convenience of wireless charging to a variety of platforms.”<br><br>“Our customers are always looking for streamlined solutions for charging their digital pens, and Renesas provided us with the much-needed support to deliver a premier solution for our consumers with the small size and power efficiency we needed,” said Sayatake Komine, EVP and head of Wacom’s Technology Solution Business Unit.<br>About Renesas Wireless Power Receivers<br><br>Renesas wireless power receivers  are also suggested for low-power applications such as earbud case charging and digital pens. A unique ping-detect feature gives an early indication of the wireless charger connection and improves thermal performance at the end of complete battery charging, says Renesas. The integrated 32-bit processor offers a high level of programmability and design parameters that can be easily configured to work with small rod coils that fit into digital pens.
