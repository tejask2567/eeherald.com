                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    EMCORE Corporation has announced that it has been awarded a solar panel manufacturing contract by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for its Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission targeted for launch in late 2014. Solar panels populated with EMCORE's advanced ZTJ triple-junction solar cells will power the SMAP spacecraft and instrument suite in near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit for the duration of mission.<br><br>The SMAP mission will provide global measurements of soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state. These measurements will be used to enhance understanding of processes that link the planet's water, energy and carbon cycles, and to extend the capabilities of weather and climate prediction models. SMAP data will also be used to quantify net carbon flux in boreal landscapes and to develop improved flood prediction and drought monitoring capabilities. For more information about the SMAP mission, visit http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/<br><br>"We are honored to continue supporting these critical missions for NASA," said Christopher Larocca, chief operating officer for EMCORE. "EMCORE successfully delivered solar panels to JPL last year for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission and have delivered, or are in the process of delivering, solar panels for several other NASA missions including the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), and the Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) missions. We look forward to working with NASA and JPL once again on this program."<br><br>EMCORE manufactures radiation-hard solar cells for space power applications. EMCORE's multi-junction solar cells provide the highest available power to interplanetary spacecraft and earth orbiting satellites.
