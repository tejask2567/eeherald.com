                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    EVE has confirmed that Texas Instruments Incorporated used its ZeBu-Server (for Zero Bugs) hardware assisted verification platform to accelerate development of its embedded software for the OMAP 5 platform.<br><br>"The EVE team and ZeBu-Server played a critical role in helping us enable Android software on our OMAP 5 platform," says Vincent Verfaillie, development platforms and tools manager, TI. "We were able to boot the Android OS on the OMAP5430 processor mapped onto ZeBu-Server in about seven minutes, which is more than 30 times faster than EVE's closest competitor. Our TI team is very satisfied with the ZeBu technology, in addition to EVE's pre- and post-sales support."<br><br>ZeBu-Server combines fast speed of execution, scalable capacity that ranges from a few million to more than one billion ASIC-equivalent gates, along with design debugging capabilities in a small footprint. Utilizing ZeBu-Server, TI was able to cut the development of the OMAP5430 processor's embedded software by six to nine months.<br><br>In 2011, TI worked to develop embedded Android software for the smart multicore OMAP5430 processor. ZeBu-Server served as a key tool in TI's Android development. Android was up and running on the first OMAP5430 processor less than two weeks after engineering samples became available. As a result, TI was able to offer public demonstrations of the Android OS booting up on the OMAP 5 processor at CES in January 2012.<br><br>"TI's success highlights real-world evidence of ZeBu-Server's effectiveness," adds Luc Burgun, EVE's chief executive officer and president. "Accelerating embedded software development is imperative in a highly competitive environment and we are proud to provide ZeBu-Server for accelerated product designs."<br><br>Visit EVE online at: http://www.eve-team.com
