                    <p>
                    Fern Howard now sells lighting products based on Rambus lighting solutions incorporating Rambus patented innovations including MicroLens optics technology.<br><br>Jeff Parker, president of the Lighting and Display Technology business at Rambus, said that "We are excited to see Rambus lighting solutions expand into the European and Middle Eastern markets with the help of Fern Howard. Using key Rambus technologies, Fern Howard fixtures will achieve a level of styling, application efficiency, and precise control of light unmatched in the bulkhead and utility lighting industry".<br><br>As per Peter Scott, managing director of Fern Howard, "We believe edge-lit technology is the much sought-after link between conventional area lighting fixtures and wide-scale LED adoption. It not only provides a pleasing, uniform light source, but when coupled with highly sophisticated MicroLens technology, enables a level of lighting control that is impossible to achieve with other, less efficient LED solutions. We are delighted to be working with Rambus and will be showing the first results of our collaboration with five new edge-lit products at Light+Build in April".<br><br>Rambus have patents for their innovations such as LED edge-lit optical designs, MicroLens light distribution features, high-volume, low-cost light guide panels, and multi-function film manufacturing technologies - these lighting solutions allow customers to exploit all the benefits of LEDs in affordable general lighting products.
