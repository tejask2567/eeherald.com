                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Tensilica, Inc has announced that its customers shipped over 300 million of its audio/voice digital signal processor cores for use in various consumer electronics appliances. Tensilica along with its 30+ partners have ported and optimized over 100 audio/voice encoders and decoders, audio enhancement software and pre-processing packages.<br><br>"The 300 million milestone is just the tip of the iceberg," said Larry Przywara, Tensilica's senior director of multimedia marketing. "By 2014 we expect to ship approximately one billion HiFi cores a year. The need to support a wide range of software packages, and the large costs associated with the support and maintenance, has resulted in many companies deciding to use our standard audio/voice DSPs. Plus, we've automated the process of customizing all of our IP cores so companies can add essential features to differentiate their cores if required."<br><br>Tensilica also focuses on maintenance and support of already developed software for audio/voice applications. The company supports seven Dolby and ten DTS audio packages on the HiFi audio/voice DSPs.<br><br>Tensilica's 3rd party audio enhancement software partners are Acoustic Technologies, AM3D, Arkamys, Audyssey, Dolby, DTS, QSound, Sensory, and SRS.<br><br>Tensilica, Inc has also announced that it added support for the dynamic resolution adaptation (DRA) standard to its library of over 100 audio encoders, decoders and sound enhancement packages for its HiFi audio DSP family.<br><br>All products that include the HiFi audio digital signal processors can be used to support the standard approved by the People's Republic of China as the national audio standard (GB/T 22726-2008) for multi-channel audio decoding.<br><br>"DRA is an approved optional audio codec standard for Blu-ray disc audio, adopted as an audio codec for the Chinese multimedia mobile broadcast (CMMB) standard," stated Larry Przywara, senior director of multimedia marketing. "It is an important audio standard for terrestrial digital TV, IPTV, internet streaming, and Blu-ray disc applications in China."<br><br>Tensilica's HiFi audio DSPs are licensable audio DSP IP cores and are part of the dataplane processors (DPUs).
