                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Dongbu HiTek has announced it has won two big contracts in the Chinese smart phone market, naming Beijing-based Tianyu Communication Equipment Company and Shenzen-based Skyworth Group as new customers. The Korean provider of specialty ICs confirmed that it has initiated volume shipments of advanced touch-screen controller chips to both companies.<br><br>The touch-screen controllers destined for China specify a 300 Hz frame rate, some three times faster than previous generation smart phones, claims Dongbu HiTek. Dongbu HiTek says this faster rate facilitates touch-drawing of continuous figures on screen without interruption. The controllers also enable 10-finger multi-touch capability for playing on-screen instruments such as a piano. Controllers consume less current of 2.5 mA compared to 10 mA for previous generation phones (based on 80 Hz frame rate). These advanced chips are ideal for use with 4.3-, 5.0- and 7.0-inch smart-phone screens.<br><br>Dongbu HiTek says its touch-screen controllers deploy a projected capacitive (pro-cap) technology as opposed to a resistive type. Pro-cap technology yields significant benefits, the most significant being: high durability for long product life; high transmissivity for excellent optical performance; and “unlimited touch” for discerning and processing simultaneous touches. According to iSuppli, the pro-cap type of touch-screen controllers will command 70% of a $1.5 billion market in 2012 and continue to maintain this lion’s share as the market reaches $1.6 billion in 2015.
