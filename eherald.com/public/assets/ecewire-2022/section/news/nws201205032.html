                    <p>
                    Cavium, Inc. has announced initial shipments of OCTEON Fusion small cell base station-on-a-chip family of SoC's to telecom equipment manufacturers (TEMs). The OCTEON Fusion family delivers capacity and throughput for LTE small cell base stations through a high performance multi-core architecture OCTEON.<br><br>OCTEON Fusion CNF71XX integrates Cavium's OCTEON multi-core architecture along with purpose-built baseband DSP cores, extensive LTE hardware accelerators and digital front end (DFE) features into a single chip. The first release of this family of silicon includes four high performance MIPS64 cores and six DSP's, along with baseband hardware acceleration units interconnected with a low-latency crossbar and shared memory subsystem. This allows service of more than 128 connected users while delivering line-rate throughput for Uplink and Downlink.<br><br>The small cell base station semiconductor market is expected to reach over $1 billion by 2016.<br>"With the shipment of OCTEON Fusion CNF71XX, service providers now have available unmatched carrier grade feature set and performance on all layers of LTE protocol in their small cell base stations," said YJ Kim, general manager of Cavium's infrastructure products group. "Increasing 4G momentum and consumers' insatiable demand for mobile data are causing service providers to accelerate small cell deployments. OCTEON Fusion along with Cavium's fully integrated and proven FusionStack LTE protocol software delivers standout performance while accelerating time to market for our TEM customers and their service provider customers".<br><br>OCTEON Fusion's architecture allows the same scalable architecture to be deployed on both indoor and outdoor radio access solutions.<br><br>Cavium is currently sampling OCTEON Fusion CNF71XX to select customers.<br><br>For more information, visit http://www.cavium.com/OCTEON-Fusion.html
