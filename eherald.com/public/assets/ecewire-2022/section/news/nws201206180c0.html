                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    AMD has announced to integrate a new security solution into its future products with secure access to their content and worry-free online transactions. Through a strategic technology partnership with ARM, AMD will integrate the established ARM TrustZone technology into future Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) via a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design methodology. This collaboration is to help accelerate broader ecosystem support by aligning x86 hardware with the mobile security ecosystem.<br><br>AMD and ARM are to provide a consistent approach to security spanning billions of Internet-connected mobile devices, tablets, PCs and servers by adopting the industry-standard approach to security that the TrustZone technology represents. The devices can be powered by ARM processor-based solutions or AMD x86 APUs. AMD plans to provide development platforms that have TrustZone security features on select APUs in 2013, expanding further across its product portfolio in 2014.<br><br>In a presentation this week at the AMD Fusion Developer Summit 2012 (AFDS), AMD senior vice president and chief information officer Mike Wolfe described AMD’s vision to advance computing security by enhancing AMD’s existing security technologies. This is expected to include developing a platform security processor using an ARM Cortex-A5 CPU that features TrustZone technology, to monitor and help protect against malicious access to sensitive data and operations at the hardware level.<br><br>“With AMD’s support for, and inclusion in, the expanding TrustZone ecosystem, consumers and businesses can rest assured their data and content are secured by an industry-standard security solution that spans a multitude of devices and operating systems,” said Wolfe. “This example of AMD’s ambidextrous strategy, which leverages our history of x86 and graphics innovation while also embracing other technologies and intellectual property, will help drive a more secure computing experience for our consumer and business customers.”<br><br>“As technology becomes more important to our everyday lives, security needs to be present in every single device. The challenge that the industry faces is how to make this a reality,” said Ian Drew, executive vice president, strategy, ARM. “Through this technology partnership with AMD, and the broadening of the ARM TrustZone technology ecosystem, we’re making another important step towards a solution. The aim is to make security accessible and consistent for consumers and business users across all computing devices.”<br><br>ARM TrustZone technology is a key component of the ARM architecture and its aim is to drive industry alignment and scalability to meet the system security needs of consumers, service providers, enterprises and device manufacturers.<br><br>The hardware is being aligned to an industry-standard security solution between multiple processor architectures. We need to wait and watch how far the solutions meet the present day’s demand.
