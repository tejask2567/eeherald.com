                    India's mobile phone brand Karbonn Mobiles is shipping in volumes its new Android 4.1 'Jelly Bean' tablet made using China based Ingenic Semiconductor SoC chip. Ingenic J4770 is MIPS based SoC for tablets. Most of the leading tablets from other brands are powered by ARM processor cores. MIPS is leveraging its Chinese customers to compete in the tablet space in emerging markets.<br><br>The Karbonn Smart Tab 1 tablet is priced at Rs. 6999 and is well stocked by popular mobile phone retail shops in India.<br><br>MIPS shared in its release a bit of market info estimated by ABI Research, where the Indian media tablet market is estimated to grow with a CAGR of 71% from 2011 to 2017. "2012 is an important year for media tablets in India as an increasing number of models designed for the India market become available at different price tiers," says mobile devices practice director Jeff Orr. "Keys to success for tablet vendors will be localized content, seamless connectivity, and providing an enhanced user experience."<br><br>"With its unmatched combination of high performance and ultra-low power consumption, the MIPS-Based Ingenic SoC was a natural choice for our new tablet. Long battery life, leading-edge features and a wealth of local content make the Karbonn Smart Tab 1 tablet an ideal product for the Indian market. Building on our success with mobile handsets in India, Karbonn is pleased to be a leader in bringing an Android 4.1 tablet to market, and the first company in the world to offer an Android 4.1 tablet at such an affordable price point. We intend to be the leading marketer in the Indian tablet market wherein we wish to reach up to 200 thousand units per month by focusing on enterprise business solutions segmentation, education, healthcare, hospitality and next-generation business verticals," said Pradeep Jain, managing director, Karbonn Mobiles.<br><br>"This new tablet demonstrates continued adoption of our cost-effective JZ4770 SoC in mobile devices. The JZ4770 SoC leverages the simplicity and elegance of the MIPS architecture, and features extremely low power consumption, 1.2GHz performance, and a high level of functional integration. Millions of tablets are already shipping around the globe based on our design, and we anticipate increasing success as more and more companies recognize the differentiation our solution can enable," said Qiang Liu, chairman and CEO of Ingenic Semiconductor.<br><br>"After joining with Ingenic to announce the world's first Android 4.0 'Ice Cream Sandwich' tablet in December, we have achieved numerous additional tablet design wins. Working closely with Ingenic and its OEMs, we are seeing increasing success for the MIPS architecture in tablets, especially in emerging markets such as China, Indonesia and now India. With our deep expertise in Android development, we are able to quickly port new versions of Android to MIPS-Based devices, with speed that is second only to Google itself," said Gideon Intrater, vice president of marketing, MIPS Technologies.
