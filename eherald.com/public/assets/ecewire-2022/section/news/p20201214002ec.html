                    <p>
                    Cobham announced Wind River’s real-time operating system VxWorks is now available  for the RISC-V based NOEL-V processor IP core from its design center, Cobham Gaisler.Wind River recently introduced RISC-V support in Simics and VxWorks, for which the NOEL-V BSP has been developed.<br><br>“RISC-V brings the dynamism of open architecture development to hardware. By working together with Cobham Gaisler to deliver VxWorks support, we are further contributing to the growth of the collaborative RISC-V ecosystem and community,” said Devon Yablonski, Senior Director, Aerospace and Defense Solutions, Wind River.<br><br> “Supporting the market leading VxWorks RTOS is an important step for the software ecosystem around NOEL-V, and we continue to enable space applications to leverage Wind River’s wide software ecosystem,” said Sandi Habinc, General Manager of the Cobham Gaisler Design Center. “The availability of VxWorks support in turn enables NOEL-V to be applied in other domains, such as automotive.”<br><br>Wind River and CAES are Strategic Members of RISC-V International which directs the future development and adoption of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to enable a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. The VxWorks NOEL-V BSP is available in single-core and SMP configurations for the FPGA platforms for which free NOEL-V bitstreams are available at www.cobhamaes.com/gaisler.  <br><br>The NOEL-V is a synthesizable VHDL model of a 64 bit processor that implements the RISC-V architecture. The processor is the first released model in Cobham Gaisler's RiSC-V line of processors that complement the LEON line of processors.
