                    North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment posted $1.46 billion in orders worldwide in June 2012 (three-month average basis) and a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94, according to the June Book-to-Bill Report published today by SEMI. A book-to-bill of 0.94 means that $94 worth of orders were received for every $100 of product billed for the month.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide bookings in June 2012 was $1.46 billion. The bookings figure is 9.8 percent lower than the final May 2012 level of $1.61 billion, and is 5.5 percent lower than the June 2011 order level of $1.54 billion.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide billings in June 2012 was $1.55 billion. The billings figure is 1.0 percent more than the final May 2012 level of $1.54 billion, and is 5.2 percent less than the June 2011 billings level of $1.64 billion.<br><br>“Following seven months of increases, the three-month average bookings declined in June and likely reflects some slowing in investment plans attributed to weaknesses in the broader economy,” said Denny McGuirk, president and CEO of SEMI. "While order activity may slow, equipment spending this year will continue to be directed towards advanced technologies in wafer processing and packaging assembly.”<br><br>The SEMI book-to-bill is a ratio of three-month moving averages of worldwide bookings and billings for North American-based semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Billings and bookings figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.<br><br>Source: SEMI
