                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    The electronics technology distributor Avnet is supporting Indian electronics industry by playing design partner kind of a role for Indian electronics enterprises, that’s the way Avnet supports its customers worldwide. Along with selling high-end semiconductor devices such as FPGAs and SoC chips and also the basic passive electronic components, Avnet provides research and development support to its clients by fully developing the end product or offering any percentage of R&D services customer choose where bits and pieces of design services are offered. Avnet sources to its customers most of the design information such as reference designs, part life cycle info and component sources for the Bill of Materials (BOM).<br><br>Avnet uses very effectively its annual event called X-Fest to reach the design community. However in India, this year's (2012) X-Fest event's content, presentation and demos were built around recently launched 28nm FPGA chips from Xilinx. The event was quite focused on 28nm FPGA chip families called Artix, Kintex, Virtex and Zynq. It indicates Avnet is stocking good number of Xilinx 28nm chips in its inventory.<br><br>Avnet on its own designed and made available a board/kit priced below $399 based on Zynq chip. Zynq packs ARM Cortex 9 dual core processor and FPGA fabric in a single chip. Its well thought out learning/prototyping board helping non-FPGA engineer to explore FPGA for complex embedded systems design.<br><br>While interacting with media, Ramani.S, Managing Director, Avnet India shared his thoughts on Indian Electronics industry.<br><br>Noticing Avnet being a logistics expert, this writer asked whether infrastructure in India has improved in moving goods faster. Ramani says things have tremendously improved now compared to 5 years back. He finds improvement in air-connection, road networks, quick clearance of goods from ship-yards and custom offices.<br><br>There is a problem for Indian companies to buy latest and advanced components by paying rupees. Not only from Avnet even to buy chips from many leading distributors, Indian companies need to pay in US$. Ramani says Avnet is looking at offering Rupee buying for all its stocked components in the coming years. However he didn't spell out exact time-frame for that to happen. It makes sense for Avnet to go for local stocking and billing because it get approximately 30% of its revenue from Asia, and 25% of Avnet's Asia revenues are from S. Asia, where India has large share.<br><br>Large and medium electronics OEMs in India extensively use Avnet for component sourcing support and design support. SMEs and startups should not be left out in utilizing services from big technology distributors such as Avnet. Rupee billing, small quantity order accepting, and local ware house from leading distributors will help the growth Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) in India.<br><br>Avnet India<br><br>Picture: (Left to Right) Issac W.C.
