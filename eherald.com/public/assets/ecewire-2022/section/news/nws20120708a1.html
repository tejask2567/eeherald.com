                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    AIXTRON SE has announced the successful conclusion of the European Commission-funded “TECHNOTUBES” (Technology for Wafer-Scale Carbon Nanotubes) project, with a demonstration of its new automated growth equipment, BM 300T.<br><br>AIXTRON says the aim of the 3-year project was to develop growth processes, automated equipment, quality control/monitoring and a variety of end-applications based on carbon nanotubes. The members of the project consortium were the University of Cambridge (coordinator), ETH Zurich, TU Denmark, TU Berlin, Fritz Haber Institute, CNR-Italy, Philips, THALES, Cambridge CMOS Sensors, IMEC, and AIXTRON.<br><br>Prof. John Robertson, the project coordinator from the University of Cambridge, comments, “This unique project brings together world-class partners from industry and research to create a carbon nanotube value chain, from growth equipment to material production to exploitable devices. The key applications that emerged from this project include interconnects, thermal interface materials, medical and security X-ray sources, gas detectors, biological probes, microfluidics and novel energy storage devices. We are grateful to the European Commission for providing the funding which made this project possible.”<br><br>Dr. Ken Teo, Director of Nanoinstruments adds, “Our role at AIXTRON was to create a system capable of depositing various carbon nanotube structures that met the requirements of these applications. The challenge was to integrate various processes (single-wall, multi-wall, straight vertical nanotubes) into a single platform offering the uniformity, repeatability and a high degree of automation that industrial production partners demand. The BM 300T system we have developed successfully achieves these goals by enabling high throughput, wafer-scale carbon nanotube production, incorporating thermal and plasma deposition, precursor activation and a novel wafer loading and heating system.”
