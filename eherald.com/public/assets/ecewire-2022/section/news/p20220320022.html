                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Omnispace and Lacuna Space are collaborating on the distribution of a ground-breaking internet of things (IoT) service. The collaboration will enable the commercial launch of a first-of-its-kind, global, open standards-based IoT network. The service will employ the LoRaWAN protocol to support direct-to-satellite communications for a broad range of IoT devices. The protocol will utilize the LR-FHSS technology -- specifically designed for high-capacity IoT networks -- with on- orbit operation validated by Lacuna through several years of non-geostationary satellite testing and optimization. Leveraging Omnispace’s licensed, 2GHz S-band spectrum rights, and integrating Omnispace and Lacuna infrastructure, the service will allow devices to connect seamlessly between existing terrestrial networks and previously un-connected regions around the globe.<br><br>“Omnispace is reimagining mobile communications for users by employing standards-based solutions to deliver global, real-time connectivity,” said Ram Viswanathan, president and CEO for Omnispace. “We’re pleased to be working with Lacuna to introduce this new enterprise-class service, which is part of our broader vision to deliver seamless terrestrial and satellite communications.”<br><br>“We are happy to announce this agreement with Omnispace which accelerates getting our technology to market and enables us to start delivering our IoT services around the globe,” said Rob Spurrett, CEO of Lacuna. “Our customers will be able to access Lacuna’s IoT service<br>directly from inexpensive, battery-powered LoRa® devices to extend connectivity to even the most remote areas of the world.”<br><br>This joint Omnispace and Lacuna effort will begin serving customers and distribution partners in Q3-2022, powering asset tracking, fleet management and data collection across industries globally. The two companies will leverage the LoRaWAN standard that is capable<br>of bridging terrestrial networks with worldwide satellite coverage to offer low power ubiquitous connectivity. The initial set of Lacuna sensors are smaller than the palm of a hand and can connect over satellite for several years off a single battery charge, providing<br>customers with affordable and simplified communications.
