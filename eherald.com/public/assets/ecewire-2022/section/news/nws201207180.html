                    <p>
                    In the current market situation, its tough to show even a single digit revenue growth by semiconductor chip makers. Intel has reported a 5% growth in revenue for 2nd Q 2012 on quarter-over-quarter basis.<br>The industrial computing focus, and ultrabook and allinone PC trend might be yielding good results for Intel.<br><br>Intel reported quarterly revenue of $13.5 billion, operating income of $3.8 billion, net income of $2.8 billion and EPS of $0.54. The company generated approximately $4.7 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.1 billion and used $1.1 billion to repurchase stock.<br><br>"The second quarter was highlighted by solid execution with continued strength in the data center and multiple product introductions in Ultrabooks and smartphones," said Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. "As we enter the third quarter, our growth will be slower than we anticipated due to a more challenging macroeconomic environment. With a rich mix of Ultrabook and Intel-based tablet and phone introductions in the second half, combined with the long-term investments we're making in our product and manufacturing areas, we are well positioned for this year and beyond."<br><br>Intel's outlook for Q3 2012: Revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.<br>Intel's outlook for Full-Year 2012: Revenue up between 3 percent and 5 percent year over year, down from the prior expectation for high single-digit growth.<br><br>The leader again shows what it takes to be a leader in odd times.
