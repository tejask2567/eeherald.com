                    <p>
                    Fujitsu is using VxWorks RToS, Wind River Linux and Wind River Hypervisor for the development of their next generation of ETERNUS RAID disk storage systems.<br><br>“We needed a flexible and reliable development environment to manage increasing software complexity resulting from multicore deployment as well as secure performance. Wind River’s comprehensive portfolio and deep expertise helped us unlock multicore capabilities, and Fujitsu was able to significantly shrink the time and cost for development,” said Mr. Shigeo Konno, general manager of the Storage Systems Division at Fujitsu Limited.<br><br>“Having a global leader like Fujitsu relying on a variety of our technologies speaks to Wind River’s trusted software and expertise,” said Warren Kurisu, vice president of product marketing at Wind River. “By providing a comprehensive set of solutions, including the industry leading RTOS, embedded Linux and virtualization technologies and support, Wind River allows Fujitsu to streamline the development process and deliver powerful devices capable of handling the storage needs of today and future networks.”
