                    The South East Asia region is showing good signs of growth in semiconductor and electronics industry. The major regions of growth now are Malaysia and Phillipines.<br><br>Thailand, though an important region is recovering from the flood shock. The Singapore continues to retain its tag as a favorite destination for chip fabrication and design.<br><br>As per news story by Malaysia Star, Malaysia's semiconductor industry is growing due to demand in China. Malaysia Star has reported "rising consumption of PCs in China and increased global semiconductor spending are expected to drive the growth of local automated semiconductor equipment and chip-assembly companies in the second quarter, following a sluggish first quarter."<br><br>Vitrox Corp Bhd, Pentamaster Corp Bhd and Globetronics Technology Bhd are some of the companies expecting good business in the coming quarters.<br><br>Read the full story at: http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/4/23/business/11149266&sec=business<br><br>Philippines is known for investment by semiconductor packaging companies, which is generating huge employment for broad section of talent, including less-educated work-force. Recently at an industry event, Philippines President Benigno Aquino was praising the semiconductor and electronics industry for its contribution to the Philippine economy. He was addressing the participants of the World Electronics Forum and the Semiconductor and Electronic Industries in the Philippines Inc. (Seipi) general membership meeting held at Shangri-La"s Mactan Island Resort and Spa, Cebu, Philippines.<br><br>Electronic industry in Philippines has attracted an investment of $4.49 billion in Jan and Feb 2012, a 7% increase from the same period in 2011. The bulk of these investments came from the semiconductor subsector, as per Seipi.<br><br>South East Asia has reaped the electronics industry market opportunities to generate employment for poor and less educated people.<br><br>India with a huge population of skilled work-force should never allow to loose another opportunity present now in the electronics industry in providing economic growth and job creation for the masses.
