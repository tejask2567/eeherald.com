                    STMicroelectronics is getting away from wireless and new strategy is on two product-segment organizations which it calls as: Sense & Power and Automotive Products; and Embedded Processing Solutions. Sense & Power includes MEMS and sensors, power discrete and advanced analog products. In Automotive Products ST to focus onpowertrain to safety, and from body to infotainment. The Embedded Processing Solutions segment includes microcontrollers, imaging products, digital consumer products, application processors and digital ASICs.<br><br>Comments by Carlo Bozotti, President and CEO of ST:<br>“Today we are announcing the new ST, aligned with the new market environment, Based on that, we have made the decision to exit ST-Ericsson after a transition period. We will continue to support ST-Ericsson as their supply-chain partner, advanced process-technology partner and application-processor IP provider.”<br>“The new ST will be more focused, leaner and better positioned to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders, targeting to rapidly achieve operating margins of 10 percent.”<br><br>ST said it will address an estimated $140 billion market in 2013 and has significant potential to grow and gain market share.<br><br>“The opportunities in this industry are extremely exciting,” said Bozotti. “As semiconductors continue to be more pervasive, we see a world where ST products are everywhere microelectronics make a positive contribution to people’s lives. With our new strategic plan, we will grow faster, be more profitable and overall become an even stronger company.”<br><br>ST to say bye-bye to ST-Ericsson after a transition period and is currently in negotiations on exit options. ST says this disengagement process has started, with the transition expected to end during the third quarter of 2013. ST said it will continue to support ST-Ericsson as its supply-chain partner, advanced process-technology partner (FD-SOI) and application-processor IP provider.
