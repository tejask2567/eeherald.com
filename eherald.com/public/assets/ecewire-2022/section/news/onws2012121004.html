<title>DLNA, HomePlug, MoCA and Wi-Fi to conduct live demo at CES 2013



"From wired to wireless devices, DLNA Certified® products take advantage of the high speeds and broad deployments of home networking technologies," said Nidhish Parikh, chairman and president of DLNA. "As part of this year’s joint alliance activity at CES we will be showcasing the flexibility for consumers to enjoy their photos, music and videos on DLNA Certified products where they want it and when they want it."

"HomePlug Certified products deliver reliable performance and true plug and play networking for millions of consumers worldwide," said Rob Ranck, president of the HomePlug Alliance. "We are delighted to join with the three other alliances at CES 2013 that share the vision of enabling a connected lifestyle for consumers."

"It is an honor to be with the industry’s most established and respected home networking standard alliances. Through our collective presence, we demonstrate to the industry, from service provider to equipment vendor to consumer, that the technologies for getting media where you want it, when you want it are all represented," said Rob Gelphman, VP of Marketing and Member Relations, MoCA.

"We are now in the era of the truly connected home, and Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ products help realize the full potential of easy-to-use connectivity in appliances, electronics, computers and more," said Wi-Fi Alliance marketing and program management director Kelly Davis-Felner. "We’re pleased to work with other organizations and our member companies to bring the connected home to life on the show floor."
