                    While over-capacity continues to plague the global PV industry, the Taiwan PV industry is operating at high-capacity. Taiwan PV manufacturers are likely to capitalize on their competitive advantages in crystalline silicon cells and modules and the punitive duties placed on Chinese products in the U.S., while expanding their global role in thin-film technologies, balance of systems and other sectors of solar industry. These positive industry dynamics are to be displayed at PV Taiwan (October 3-5) in Taipei. Registration is now open at www.pvtaiwan.com.<br><br>The PV manufacturing equipment industry starts recovering from record low and is to be at the beginning of long-term growth cycle and to vastly contribute to energy independence. On the supply side, with a 17 percent market share in PV cell production, Taiwan is the second-largest PV manufacturing base worldwide. Last year, China and Taiwan, the two major dominating regions, together produced over 70 percent of the world’s PV cells and held more than 50 percent market share in both C-Si cells and modules production capacity. On the demand side, Asia is predicted to rouse a strong year-end surge in PV demand, according to a recently published research from NPD Solarbuzz. On the other hand, according to IMS Research, a 20 GW opportunity is predicted for the upgrade or replacement of existing capacity over the next four years. With that, SEMI Taiwan predicts that there could be a 2.5~3GW opportunity in Taiwan, mostly through upgrade or replacement of existing PV fabs and equipment.<br><br>Recognizing Taiwan’s growing importance to the global solar market, more than 200 exhibitors and 8,000 visitors are to participate in PV Taiwan 2012. Organized by SEMI and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), PV Taiwan to feature a comprehensive market and technology conference, the PV Taiwan Forum; theme pavilions on PV cells and modules, HCPV (High Concentrated Photovoltaic), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), and new products; and business matching programs to launch new products and technologies to both Taiwan and international buyers. “With a promising upside ahead, PV Taiwan 2012 brings the excitement of expanding business opportunities globally by organizing an international buyer program for finding business partners and prospects,” said Terry Tsao, president of SEMI Taiwan and Southeast Asia. “PV Taiwan continues to promote the development of the PV industry and helps the supply chain stay competitive in times of economic uncertainty.”<br><br>“With a stable supply chain network with products ranging from various silicon products to solar modules, Taiwan has emerged as one of the manufacturing centers for PV products especially in Asia Pacific region” said Dr. P.H. Chang, CEO of Motech. “With combination of key forums and exhibition, PV Taiwan is a premier event and one-stop-sourcing and learning platform for the global PV industry to showcase the latest trends and technology, access business partners and encourage the procurement of high-quality PV products.”<br><br>The PV Taiwan 2012 international forums feature more than 20 international speakers who will share insider information on the latest market and technology trends. The presentations are to focus on the real, critical issues and current challenges for both today’s PV manufacturing and tomorrow’s technology advancements. The PV Taiwan 2012 forums cover business and technical sessions with CEO, market deployment and advanced technologies forums. The CEO Forum and the Market Deployment Forum feature these speakers:<br>Mr. Hua Shu, executive president, GCL<br>Mr. Jifan Gao, chairman and CEO, Trinasolar<br>Dr. Quincy Lin, chairman and CEO, NSP<br>Dr. Hur-Long Lin, CEO, Green Energy Technology<br>Mr. Walt Cheng, managing director, DuPont Electronics & Communications, Greater China, DuPont<br>Mr. Sascha Rossmann, vice president of Global Sales, Win Win Precision Technology Co., Ltd.<br>Mr. David Hsieh, president, Walsin<br>Ms. Amy Zhang, CEO, Sky Solar<br>Mr. Antonio Ganadeiro, president, ABEER<br>Mr. Zhen Guo Li, chairman, Xi'an LONGI Silicon Materials Corp.<br>Dr. Bing Dai, CTO, GCL Solar<br>Mr. Guojun Wei, RD Center Director, Zhejiang Jinggong Science & Technology Co., Ltd.<br>Mr. Frank van Mierlo, CEO, 1366 Technologies Inc.<br>Mr. Joel Kearns, vice president of Solar Wafer R&D, MEMC<br>Mr. Charles Hung, president of Power Instrument Business Center, MOTECH<br><br>Source: SEMI<br><br>Register for Solar PV Taiwan at: www.pvtaiwan.com
