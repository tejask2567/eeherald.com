                    <p>
                    Rambus Inc has received the "Best paper award" for one of the papers it presented at the recent 2012 DesignCon. The paper, titled, "Design and characterization of the power supply system for a high-speed 1600 Mbps DDR3 interface in wirebond package", was awarded in the DesignCon board and system level design category.<br><br>The Rambus engineers outlined a supply system design methodology for high-speed interface systems used in the design of a 1600 Mbps DDR3 interface in wirebond package. The paper discusses the power integrity challenges for high-speed memory interfaces and how they require a system-level approach which includes supply noise mitigation. The paper also demonstrated the full spectrum of power integrity considerations typical in the design of high-speed interfaces in order to achieve reliable system performance at high data rates.<br><br>A live demonstration of the interface solution was also presented by Rambus within its booth during the DesignCon conference.<br><br>"DesignCon paper awards recognize outstanding contributions to the educational goals of the DesignCon program. Papers are judged both on the merits of the written document and on the quality of their presentation at DesignCon 2012. We congratulate these authors for producing a high-quality paper and presenting it in a lucid and compelling manner," said Barry Sullivan, content director at UBM Electronics.<br><br>To access the Rambus 2012 DesignCon paper, visit http://designcon.com/paper_winners
