                    In-Stat has reported the tablet use has begun to crossover from the consumer world into the workplace. In-Stat finds that the most common business uses of tablets are email/calendar management, note taking, and presentations, with 77% reporting email as a common workplace use.<br><br>"Email is by far the most dominant tablet application for business users" says Frank Dickson, VP Mobile Research. "However, when you dig into the data, you find a plethora of strong niche uses arising. When business tablet users are asked to list ALL the applications they use, note taking, for example, is listed as the second most popular application. However, when survey respondents are asked to only select their most important uses, note taking is at the bottom of that list. In addition to email, customer relationship management and IT network intelligence are listed as 'most important' uses."<br><br>In-Stat also share below points from its survey:<br>Less than half of respondents felt they were allowed to connect to the corporate network.<br>The current dynamic is that users are bringing their own tablets into the workplace.<br>Only 22% of owners in our survey had their tablets paid for by their companies.<br>There is a high correlation between the usage of 3G on tablets and the frequency of business travel.
