                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    RF semiconductor devices for 5G wireless infrastructure market accounts for about 50% of new device sales as per the latest market findings from ABI research. The total RF semiconductor market for wireless infrastructure is estimated by ABI at US$ 1.5 billion in 2019. <br><br>Geographically along with China and Asia-Pacific,  North America is also driving this market followed by Europe. <br><br>ABI's research director Lance Wilson says “Historically, China and A/P have dominated growth in RF power devices for wireless infrastructure but now other regions, principally North America and Europe, are starting to assert themselves.”<br><br>However ABI sees 4G/LTE air interface to continue as a technology engine of revenue for the next five-years.  This industry is now seeing major shipments of Si LDMOS for 5G with the increasing share of GaN (Gallium Nitride) devices .<br><br>“The increasing and critical need for wireless data remains an important driver for the overall market for RF power semiconductor devices,” Wilson concludes.
