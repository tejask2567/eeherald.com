                    According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, mobile phone products will soon see a wave of new model upgrades, and lithium-polymer batteries will relive the glory of 2011, with penetration rate forecasted to increase from 3% to 15%. As for the notebook market, affected by the introduction of new models in the weak sales season, key components such as lithium battery cores showed flat price trends for the month; a greater diversity of new products should begin hitting the market in March.<br><br>Electronics Engineering Herald<br><br>Source: EnergyTrend<br><br>Other analysis as per EnergyTrend:<br><br>Mobile Phone Batteries to Follow "Light" Trend Too: The popularization of smartphones was undeniably a highlight of the handheld device market in 2011. Furthermore, mobile phone batteries have gradually evolved from prismatic lithium-ion to thin and light lithium-polymer; although li-poly battery cost is not low due to high levels of customization, with appropriate power management and protection ICs, cost can be maintained within a reasonable range. In the future, internal batteries will be used in lieu of replaceable batteries, but consumer reaction and acceptance remains to be seen. Internal li-poly battery penetration rate is estimated to increase from 3% to over 15% in 2012.<br><br>Battery Price Trend Flat: As the February release of new standard notebook models has been postponed, cylindrical cell demand is flat. While many ultrabooks were released in 4Q11, due to high levels of customization, the newest models will not hit the market and stimulate a new wave of hardware demand until March 2012 at the earliest.
