Si2 is the organization of semiconductor, systems, EDA and manufacturing companies focused on the development and adoption of standards to improve the way integrated circuits are designed and manufactured, in order to speed time-to market, reduce costs, and meet the challenges of sub-micron design.<br><br>Jeong-Tyng Li has more than 25 years of EDA and semiconductor experience. Prior to his current executive position at SpringSoft, he was CEO and co-founder of Nanovata Design Automation and worked in various senior management and technology development roles at Nassda, Avant!, PiE Design Systems, Inc.

Dr. Li holds a B.S. degree from National Taiwan University and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of California at Berkeley.<br><br>"SpringSoft has established itself as a leader in providing open, interoperable solutions, as evidenced by the company's long-standing commitment to OpenAccess. We welcome SpringSoft and Dr. Li to the Board, and are excited to leverage their global industry perspective and collaborative approach, both of which are key to ensuring the continued success of Si2's mission," said Steve Schulz, Si2 president and CEO.<br><br>"The work Si2 is doing is important for advancing chip development methodologies that are critical to the future success of the industry, and I'm both honored and privileged to join Si2's Board of Directors," said SpringSoft's Dr. Li. "I look forward to helping Si2 drive the implementation of open standards into practical solutions that provide the catalyst for greater interoperability, faster innovation, and the next generation of IC and SoC designs."<br><br>Organization's website: www.si2.org
