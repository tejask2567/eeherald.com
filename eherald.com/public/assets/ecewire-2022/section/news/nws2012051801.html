                    <p>
                    The Program Committee of the 3rd Annual COMSOL Conference has announced that it is now accepting paper and poster abstracts to be considered for presentation at its 2012 India COMSOL Conference on multiphysics modeling and simulation going to be held on on November 2-3 at Bangalore, India.<br><br>Worldwide, the COMSOL Conference connects more than 2,000 engineers and scientists from all industries, government, and academia. The Conference, which focuses on advancing cross-disciplinary modeling and simulation techniques and sharing best practices, offers attendees in-depth training sessions, panel discussions, networking events, and keynote speeches from industry leaders in addition to more than 100 user presentations.<br><br>All abstract submissions will be reviewed by the 11-member Program Committee. "Each committee member has many years of successful modeling and simulation experience in research and development, product design, and/or higher education," says Lakhvinder Singh, Program Committee Chairman. "It's a great pleasure having all this simulation expertise on the Program Committee. We are looking forward to reviewing this year's abstracts. Every year the submissions are truly amazing and we enjoy every minute reading them."<br><br>Accepted papers will be delivered during the conference's user presentation breakout sessions and will be published in both the conference proceedings and the COMSOL Conference CD. The Conference CD, a complimentary, unique, and widely anticipated resource, is a compendium of hundreds of fully documented multiphysics modeling and simulation projects. Inclusion in the Conference CD, which reaches approximately 150,000 engineers and scientists, offers paper and poster presenters worldwide name recognition and valuable publicity for their projects.<br><br>The popular Poster Session held on the first day of the event invites conference attendees to cast their votes for the Best Poster. The winner of the Best Poster is announced during the Networking Dinner that evening. After dinner, attendees return to the Poster Session to meet with presenters and discuss their work.<br><br>Prospective presenters are invited to submit their paper and poster abstracts for the Program Committee to review at www.comsol.co.in/conference2012/papers. Presenters submitting an abstract by July 13th receive a discount on the conference registration fee. The final submission deadline for abstracts is August 31th .<br><br>Suggested topic areas for papers and posters include, but are not limited to:<br><br><br> Acoustics & Vibrations<br> Batteries & Fuel Cells<br> Bioscience & Bioengineering<br> Chemical Reaction Engineering<br> Computational Fluid Dynamics<br> Education<br> Electrochemistry<br> Electrodynamics<br> Electromagnetics<br> Geophysics<br> Heat Transfer & Phase Change<br> Electromagnetics<br> MEMS & Piezoelectric Devices<br> Microfluidics<br> Multiphysics<br> Nanotechnology<br> Numerical Methods<br> Optics, Photonics & Plasmonics<br> Optimization<br> Particle Tracing<br> Plasma Physics<br> Porous Media Flow<br> Quantum Mechanics<br> RF & Microwaves<br> Semiconductor Devices<br> Sensors & Actuators<br> Structural Mechanics<br> Transport Phenomena<br><br>For full details on the 2012 COMSOL Conference Bangalore, go to www.comsol.co.in/conference2012/papers.
