                  <p class="title-text"> Javelin selects Kilopass’ XPM memory IP Core for MIPI RFFE digital interface </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Kilopass Technology Inc. has announced that Javelin Semiconductor has selected the XPM (eXtra Permanent Memory) Non Volatile Memory (NVM) Intellectual Property (IP) core for its latest product development. Javelin Semiconductor prepares to incorporate Kilopass’ NVM IP into next-generation products that include the MIPI RFFE digital interface and support programmable capabilities.<br><br>“Using a standard CMOS process, Javelin can easily integrate advanced functionality to address the increasing complexity of the RF front-end in 3G/HSPA and 4G/LTE smartphones,” said Eric Smith, vice president of operations at Javelin. “In looking for NVM storage for use with the MIPI RFFE interface in our next generation products, the Kilopass XPM NVM IP was the ideal solution for containing configuration and control data. Implemented in standard logic CMOS and available at major CMOS foundries, the Kilopass IP meets our design requirements.”<br><br>Kilopass XPM NVM IP memory is built with standard logic CMOS requiring no added manufacturing steps and is the suitable non-volatile storage medium for mobile handheld chipsets from power amplifiers to application processors. The XPM IP offers the ability to improve yield through calibration and to change functionality through configuration for the analog mixed signal chipsets. For complex SOC chipsets, the IP allows secure embedded NVM in bleeding edge processes. Combining XPM NVM storage with the MIPI RFFE digital interface in Javelin products permits advanced features and increases the application range of the products.<br><br>“We are thrilled that Javelin Semiconductor chose Kilopass for their next-generation design,” said Linh Hong, vice president of marketing and sales at Kilopass Technology. “The PA now implemented in bulk silicon instead of GaAs enables added features as well as improving the cost. Adoption of new interface standards including MIPI RFFE opens another opportunity for Kilopass to provide differentiation to the analog/mixed-signal market by creating personality to each chip.”<br><br>The MIPI Alliance Specification for RF Front-End Control Interface (RFFE) was developed to provide a common method for controlling RF front-end devices.
