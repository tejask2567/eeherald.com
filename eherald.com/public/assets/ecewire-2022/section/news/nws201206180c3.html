                    <p>
                    Anritsu Company has announced to demonstrate the broadband Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) system that can conduct single sweeps from 70 kHz to 140 GHz in its booth (#807) at the International Microwave Symposium (IMS), to be held June 19-21, in Montreal. The on-wafer device characterization is among one of the demonstrations to be conducted in Anritsu's booth to emphasize test solutions for high-frequency designs, including E-band applications and high-speed signal integrity measurements.<br><br>A number of higher frequency bands are gaining popularity, including 40-60 GHz for data transmission wireless backhaul between base stations, 60 GHz for Wireless LAN transmission in home and public locations, 77 GHz automotive collision avoidance systems, and 94 GHz for airport radar applications, materials measurement, and homeland security imaging systems.<br><br>The demonstration includes the company’s latest technologies such as new 0.8 mm connector, VectorStar and mm-wave modules. During the show, the VNA system to sweep from 70 kHz to 140 GHz, highlighting the broadest range of frequency characterization data in a single system. The system is to conduct a single sweep across multiple coax and waveguide bands, eliminating the need to use separate systems and associated data concatenation errors.<br><br>"Device engineers need broad frequency coverage to accurately characterize devices. To address this need, a connector that can perform above 110 GHz is required," said Bob Buxton, marketing manager, general purpose test, microwave measurements division. "Anritsu has pioneered high-frequency connectors. We were the first to develop the 40 GHz (2.92 mm) K connector and the 70 GHz (1.85 mm) V connector, and led the way on the 1 mm connector. In order to support a VNA with performance to 140 GHz, we needed to develop and support a new 0.8 mm connector."<br><br>Another display includes VectorStar used for signal integrity measurements featuring mP1800A Signal Quality Analyzer (SQA) BERT and MP1825B 4Tap Emphasis.<br><br>The other one is a high-frequency point-to-point demonstration, done in conjunction with BridgeWave Communications. This show features BridgeWave's 80 GHz Wireless Ethernet Bridge to highlight the MS2830A Signal Analyzer’s ability to verify emissions of mm-wave point-to-point wireless links.
