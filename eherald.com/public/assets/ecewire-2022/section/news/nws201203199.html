                    <p>
                    6WIND' software solution to support TI's KeyStone II multicore architecture. The 6WINDGate from 6WIND includes a full set of control plane modules, networking stack and a wide range of data plane protocols optimized for TI's KeyStone II-based multicore processors.<br><br>"We are delighted to announce the addition of TI's KeyStone II support to the 6WINDGate packet processing software," said Eric Carmes, CEO of 6WIND. "Because it addresses critical issues in network bandwidth, scalability and Quality-of-Service, 6WINDGate has been adopted by multiple tier-one TEMs and is now deployed in two-thirds of the LTE networks worldwide. Our recently announced 6WINDGate Cloud Edition solution extends these benefits to cloud infrastructure. We have worked closely with TI to implement optimized support for its KeyStone II multicore architecture within 6WINDGate and look forward to delivering high performance software solutions to TI's OEM customers."<br><br>"We're constantly looking for ways to push the envelope with our KeyStone II multicore processors," said Ramesh Kumar, business manager, multicore processors, TI. "No multicore architecture matches the performance, flexibility and power efficiency of KeyStone II and our collaboration with 6WIND gives our customers the software support they need to quickly and easily develop high performance applications."<br><br>Availability: 6WINDGate support for TI's KeyStone II multicore processors will be available in the second half of 2012.
