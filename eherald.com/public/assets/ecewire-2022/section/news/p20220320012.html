                    <p>
                    A group of semiconductor based and directly-dependent companies namely Intel, ASE, AMD, Arm, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Corp., Qualcomm Inc., Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., have together established an industry consortium to promote an open die-to-die interconnect standard called Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe). Mainly intel is behind this effort, by taking further the research work it has already done on the open Advanced Interface Bus (AIB), Intel developed the UCIe standard and donated it to the group of founding members as an open specification that defines the interconnect between chiplets within a package, enabling an open chiplet ecosystem and ubiquitous interconnect at the package level.<br><br>“Integrating multiple chiplets in a package to deliver product innovation across market segments is the future of the semiconductor industry and a pillar of Intel’s IDM 2.0 strategy,” said Sandra Rivera, executive vice president and general manager of the Datacenter and Artificial Intelligence Group at Intel. “Critical to this future is an open chiplet ecosystem with key industry partners working together under the UCIe Consortium toward a common goal of transforming the way the industry delivers new products and continues to deliver on the promise of Moore’s Law.”<br><br>After incorporation of the new UCIe industry organization this year, member companies planning to start work on the next generation of UCIe technology, including defining the chiplet form factor, management, enhanced security and other essential protocols.<br><br>The chiplet ecosystem created by UCIe is a critical step in the creation of unified standards for interoperable chiplets, which will ultimately allow for the next generation of technological innovations.   <br><br>To learn more about the UCIe consortium,  visit www.UCIexpress.org.
