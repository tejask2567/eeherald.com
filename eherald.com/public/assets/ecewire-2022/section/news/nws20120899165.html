                    Not all the mobile devices offered to have powerful processors to handle speech recognition, in those cases cloud computer network comes handy in building speech recognition feature in mobile phones. ABI Research has made a study on this and come out with a report titled “Speech Recognition in Mobile Devices” providing further details on the market for speech recognition in mobile devices in addition to a discussion on leading players in this market.<br><br>“Reaching a varied group of developers working on different OS and hardware platforms makes cloud based solutions the optimum approach to enabling the masses,” says mobile devices, content and applications senior analyst Michael Morgan. “It is the approach of using network based solutions that will drive the rapid increase in cloud based revenues.”<br><br>“Leveraging the cloud as a delivery mechanism, platform vendors can enable nearly any application developer that wishes to make its user interface experience more efficient,” adds mobile devices, content and applications senior practice director Jeff Orr. “ABI Research expects that consumers will first see the benefits of these efforts in mobile banking and retail applications.”
