                    <p>
                    STMicroelectronics has acquired the intellectual property and has hired most of the staff of the Israeli company bTendo to accelerate the propagation of the technology.<br><br>bTendo developed Scanning Laser Projection engine with ST’s MEMS expertise for pico projector. pico projectors are expected to drive the next level of technology growth of smartphones, and also can be used in digital cameras and laptops. bTendo has already sampled pico projectors to some of its potential customers.<br><br>ST explains the Scanning Laser Projection engine produces a focus-free high-resolution output that will allow users to display their video, pictures and presentations virtually anywhere. The bTendo innovative solution provides the smallest foot print available in the market with the best efficiency and meets the toughest mobile-makers design requirements. In particular, in a module smaller than 1.7cm3 and less than 5mm high, the projection engine is ideally suited for integration in even the sleekest smartphones and other portable devices.<br><br>“As a pioneer and the industry’s leading innovator in MEMS, we’re making pico-projectors small, power-friendly, and convenient enough to suit smart phones, digital cameras and laptops,” said Benedetto Vigna, Executive Vice President and General Manager of ST’s Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group. ”Combining ST’s IP and technical expertise with bTendo’s Scanning Laser Projection engine is enabling us to meet the demands of the emerging market of embedded projectors in next-generation portable consumer devices while preparing to simultaneously open up new markets.”
