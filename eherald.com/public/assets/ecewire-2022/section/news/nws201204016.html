                    <p>
                    NXP Semiconductors N.V. and HID Global are collaborating to introduce a global, generic Mobile Access solution for NFC-enabled mobile phones.<br><br>The jointly developed solution to leverage NXP and HID Global advanced reader technologies within a physical access control infrastructure. The solution supports existing HID Global readers and those based on the company's iCLASS SIO-Enabled (iCLASS SE) platform that fuels the migration of physical access control technology beyond traditional cards and readers by enabling deployment of mobile access with digital credentials. HID's iCLASS SE readers will be powered by NXP's new CLRC663 reader ICs and fully support 13.56 MHz smart cards that are ISO14443 compliant, including MIFARE DESFIRE EV1.<br><br>Dr. Selva Selvaratnam, senior vice president and chief technology officer with HID Global, said, "NXP is playing a vital role in the adoption of NFC technology among handset manufacturers and developer communities. By working together, this application can be deployed immediately on a significant number of mobile phones. We are excited to team up and combine our leadership positions in the access management market to offer the industry new leading-edge solutions."<br><br>Henri Ardevol, vice president and general manager, secure transactions with NXP Semiconductors, said, "We are very pleased to co-operate with HID Global on the development of this new solution. As leading enterprises continue to invest in mobile technology and security infrastructure, our collaboration brings real value and convenience around the world. In addition, combining HID Global's iCLASS SE readers with our MIFARE DESFire and NFC technology ensures greater interoperability in access management and accelerates adoption of NFC applications within the enterprise space."<br>Technical Details
