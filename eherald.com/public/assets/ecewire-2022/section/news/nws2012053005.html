                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cambridge Consultants has announced that it successfully completed initial trials with Iridium Communications Inc of new key components of the push-to-talk (PTT) radio system of the US Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Tactical Communications System (DTCS).<br><br>DTCS enables soldiers in isolated areas to communicate without the need for ground infrastructure and in locations where they often can't pick up a geostationary satellite's signal unless they move to higher ground. At the touch of a button, soldiers in remote combat zones or disaster areas are able to use lightweight handheld PTT radios to exchange mission-critical data with command centres across the globe.<br><br>Cambridge Consultants has developed radio transceiver electronics for DTCS handheld radios using its knowledge of the Iridium system and commercial PTT services. They have also developed the gateway infrastructure to support the DTCS service. These elements are critical in the success of the overall system. The gateway element is targeted a 'five nines' (99.999%) reliability rating to ensure that soldiers have service when they need it most.<br><br>The new technology developed by Cambridge Consultants includes advanced software radio functionality that provides multiple receiver capability and synchronisation to Iridium satellites to enhance PTT connection speed and call quality. The new encrypted bearer channels support encrypted communication within groups.<br><br>"Cambridge Consultants has a proven track record of developing technically challenging and 'mission critical' communications technologies, and bringing them to operational readiness quickly," said Iridium executive vice-president for government programs Lt Gen John Campbell (USAF-Ret). "As a result, we did not hesitate in selecting Cambridge Consultants as our technology partner for this project, and have every confidence in the company's ability to develop the electronics and software efficiently, whilst still adhering to the stringent requirements necessary for success."<br><br>Richard Traherne, head of the wireless division at Cambridge Consultants, said: "We have been working with Iridium since 2003 as its design partner, and are excited to be extending our long-term relationship on this groundbreaking project. With one of the largest independent teams of wireless product developers in the world, we combine in-depth experience of mainstream communications with our unique Iridium system knowledge, to develop compelling products for Iridium's clients. We look forward to supporting Iridium and its client - the US DoD - in launching the largest global PTT network."<br><br><br>For more information www.CambridgeConsultants.com
