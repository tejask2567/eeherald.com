                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Ramtron has said the proposal of $2.48 per share of common stock does not reflect the intrinsic value of Ramtron and is not in the best interest of Ramtron stockholders. Cypress Semiconductor with it SRAM market lead position would benefit by acquiring Ramtron which has FRAM expertise. FRAM is hot now in the embedded software space, that leaves Ramtron with other options.<br><br>“Under Eric Balzer’s leadership, Ramtron is a transformed company that is now poised to fully exploit the vast untapped opportunity for F-RAM-based low energy and high data integrity solutions in the semiconductor market,” said Dr. William G. Howard, Ramtron’s Chairman. “Over the past 18 months, he has assembled a world-class management team, successfully completed the foundry transition, resolved product supply shortages and implemented processes aimed at accelerating global adoption of F-RAM and enlarging the size of the Company’s addressable market. For the past three quarters, the Company has delivered positive net income and generated positive EBITDA. Having expanded capacity and addressed operational issues, the Company is intensely focused on delivering superior service to its customers and distributors and driving demand creation, and is gaining traction with its customer-centric sales and marketing initiatives and new product introductions.<br><br>“As a result, the Ramtron Board of Directors believes that Cypress’ unsolicited proposal fails to reflect the Company’s strengthened competitive position, F-RAM intellectual property and deep know-how, and strong prospects for long-term growth, as well as the progress being made toward expanding the Company’s product portfolio beyond specialty memory products to also include integrated semiconductor solutions,” concluded Dr. Howard.
