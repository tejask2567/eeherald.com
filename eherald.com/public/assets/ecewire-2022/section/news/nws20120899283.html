                    <p>
                    Bangalore based Cosmic Circuits is emerging as a leading brand in VLSI IP business particularly in analog and mixed signal semiconductor space. Cosmic is offering ready-to-use and tested IP for 28nm and 20nm SoC designs.<br><br>Cosmic Circuits said it has secured several key accounts in the past few months. The range of IPs by Cosmic Circuits include USB, PCIe, HDMI and MIPI M-PHY in 28 and 20nm. Cosmic Circuits says its 28nm silicon is a first pass success and expects to tape-out its first 20nm test-chip in the coming months.<br><br>Cosmic Circuits also sells physical ICs along with IPs. Its IC business unit has 5 products (ASICs) in mass-production and shipped its 20 Millionth unit in July 2012 and plans to have additional products in the market by the end of the year. This is some thing very appreciable in the India Semiconductor history, where you hardly find vendors shipping latest ICs in millions.<br><br>CEO of Cosmic Circuits, Ganapathy Subramaniam says his company’s revenue is growing at 20- 30% on cumulative basis and is investing in expansion. Aiming an aggressive growth, Cosmic is adding up VLSI semiconductor chip design talent in the areas of applications engineering, Analog /Digital design to fill engineering and engineering-management positions. The job-site url link for applying to Cosmic is http://www.cosmiccircuits.com/careers<br><br>"We have decided to make steep investments this year in both the business units. We expect number of ICs shipped by Cosmic and our Semiconductor Customers (with our IPs) to double by 2014" adds Ganapathy.<br><br>Are you looking for a cutting edge VLSI design job and also India based, try out Cosmic.
