                    <p>
                    Austriamicrosystems has announced a global sponsorship of the Freescale cup competition.<br>This competition is organized by Freescale Semiconductor in which teams of university students build, program and race intelligent, autonomous model race cars around a track. The fastest car that completes the track on its own without derailing will win the competition.<br><br>Austriamicrosystems is donating its TSL1401CL linear sensor array device. The TSL1401CL is part of a camera module that is included in every team's car kit. The forward looking TSL1401CL camera module provides data on the track edge locations, allowing the cars to automatically navigate through a variety of turns, a tunnel, speed bumps and crossings.<br><br>Building the autonomous race car also requires embedded software programming and basic circuit creation using Freescale parts which are included in the entry kit. Creation of motor control hardware and software for propulsion and steering is also the part of the competition.<br><br>"The Freescale cup provides university students with an opportunity to put their electrical and mechanical engineering skills to the test in a collaborative and fun atmosphere," said Andy Mastronardi, Freescale's director of university programs. "Our relationship with austriamicrosystems as part of the Freescale ecosystem is a long-standing and important one. Their contribution of leading-edge technology to the Freescale cup is an extension of that relationship and very important to the mission of the race. It's with the help of industry leaders, such as austriamicrosystems, that we are able to support the students of today as they become the innovators of tomorrow."<br><br>"Our organization employs more than 300 talented analog design engineers and they can each remember what it was like to be a student and just beginning in their career," said Darrell Benke, senior marketing manager, optical sensors and lighting business unit at austriamicrosystems. "As a company, a Freescale partner and a member of the technology community, we're proud to support the Freescale cup. We look forward to seeing the results produced by these talented university teams."<br><br>Information on the TSL1401CL linear sensor array, developed by TAOS (acquired by austriamicrosystems), can be found at http://www.taosinc.com/
