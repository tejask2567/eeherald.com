                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Power-One, Inc and International Rectifier have announced that they come into a non-exclusive, worldwide, Field of Use agreement for Digital Power Technology (DPT) patents from Power-One.<br><br>Power-One claims that the DPT drives increased system efficiency, improved design flexibility, faster time to market, decreased footprint size and lower system costs. DPT also enabled telemetry capability, providing access to critical information including current, temperature and voltage. Telemetry permits the system to monitor its power consumption and thermal performance, enabling designers to easily fix features such as system optimization, fault detection and predictive maintenance features into their end products.<br><br>Applications using FPGAs, ASICS, DSPs continue to drive board densities higher, requiring complex power architectures to handle the increasing number of voltage rails and output voltages dropping below 1V. Power-One stated that DPT is the right solution to meet these requirements.<br><br>"Power-One is pleased to license its Digital Power Technology to International Rectifier, a market leader in the power-management IC industry, for incorporation into its products," said Edward Carter, VP and GM Industrial and Transportation Business Unit. "With the expanding number of leading power supply and semiconductor companies partnering with Power-One, we continue to expand the market by providing energy-efficient technologies with increased functionality for our customers."<br><br>"It has become clear over the last several years that the leading server, performance desktop, communications and netcom customers are transitioning or have completed their transition from analog power to digital power," said Deepak Savadatti, vice president and general manager IR's Enterprise Power Business Unit. "This agreement validates our strong commitment to continue International Rectifier's leadership in the digital power management space."
