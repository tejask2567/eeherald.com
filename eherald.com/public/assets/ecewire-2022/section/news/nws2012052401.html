                    Pepperl+Fuchs has announced that they now fully rely on IAR Embedded Workbench for their future product development. The company chose IAR Embedded Workbench and IAR Systems' C/C++ compiler and debugger tool suite for the worldwide development of all products in their two divisions-factory automation and process automation. In accordance with the "Enterprise License Agreement" with IAR Systems, Pepperl+Fuchs can now use different IAR Embedded Workbench products according to their selected MCU technology and even transfer the licenses to different development sites worldwide.<br><br>"To design our automation components we need a universal tool suite which we can use flexibly in all sectors and at all our sites worldwide - a requirement, which IAR Embedded Workbench meets in all respects", said Dr.-Ing. Peter Adolphs, managing director at Pepperl+Fuchs. "Now our developers from Europe to the Far East have easy-to-use and powerful tools at hand, which help them to work efficiently and to design reliable high quality products."<br><br>"We are very happy that Pepperl+Fuchs has standardized on IAR Embedded Workbench for developing their sensors and automation components", said Thomas Winkler, director European sales at IAR Systems. "Through our individual license agreements we provide for our customers' need for maximized flexibility and for their efforts to optimize development costs."<br><br>IAR Embedded Workbench is an integrated development environment for developing, building, and debugging embedded applications with strong requirements on performance and reliability. It is the C/C++ compiler and debugger tool chain for 8-, 16-, and 32-bit MCUs.
