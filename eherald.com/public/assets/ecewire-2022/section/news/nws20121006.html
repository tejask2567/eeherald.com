                    ABI Research projects the MEMS sensor market in mobile devices to be valued at $1.2 billion by the end of 2012 and reach $2.8 billion in 2017.<br><br>“Although mobile device unit shipments are the primary driver for the bulging MEMS sensors market; there are numerous other factors in play propelling MEMS sensor growth in the mobile device sector,” says senior analyst Josh Flood. “Smartphone users expect their device to be intuitive and capable of interacting without pressing a button. Sensors make this possible — from changing the device orientation view to turning or tilting the device whilst playing a game.”<br><br>The most common sensor is the accelerometer, enabling devices to switch from a portrait to landscape display by simply turning it. More than 4 out of every 5 smartphones shipped this year to contain an accelerometer and ABI Research forecasts 32% of MEMS sensor shipments are to be accelerometers in mobile devices. Nevertheless, gyroscopes were the largest portion of the MEMS sensor market in revenue terms and are to reach $350 million this year.<br><br>MEMS sensors play a key role with mobile service and application companies. The sensors enable mobile network operators, app designers, and mobile device operating systems to provide better and more interactive features to different mobile devices. Smartphones are the largest market for MEMS sensors in mobile devices. The total annual revenues for sensors are to be $1.3 billion by the end of 2012. MEMS sensor revenues for smartphones are predicted to be worth $4.4 billion in 2017. Media tablets were the second largest market for MEMS sensors in mobile devices and are predicted to be almost $835 million in 2017.<br><br>Source: ABI
