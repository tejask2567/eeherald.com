                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Atmel Corporation has announced the company will be demonstrating Arduino's latest development boards based on Atmel AVR UC3, megaAVR and SAM3X8 ARM processor-based MCUs in booth #82 at the San Mateo Maker Faire May 19-20.<br><br>The three development boards that enable design engineers to quickly get their project or design started within the Arduino ecosystem include:<br><br>1. Arduino Due: Based on an Atmel ARM Cortex-M3 processor-based MCU, also known as the Atmel     SAM3 MCU, the Due board is suitable for home automation projects and can run up to 96MHz.<br>2. Arduino WiFi Shield: Built for WiFi applications, the Arduino WiFi shield is powered by Atmel's AVR     UC3 MCU and a H&D wireless module, and provides developers a WiFi interface.<br>3. Arduino Leonardo: Based on the Atmel megaAVR ATmega32U4, the Arduino Leonardo is a low-cost     Arduino board. It has the same shape and connectors as the UNO but it has a simpler circuit. On the     software side it has a USB driver able to simulate a mouse, a keyboard, and a serial port.<br><br>"The great collaboration between Arduino and Atmel has enabled us to introduce these new platforms to the community," said Massimo Banzi, founder of the Arduino Community. "Our collaboration enables the open-source community to access the most cost-effective development boards for projects across numerous market segments and applications. We are thrilled Atmel is showcasing our latest development boards at the Maker Faire, and continues to be such a strong advocate for our mission."<br><br>"Atmel is committed to Arduino and its open-source community," said Alf Egil-Bogen, chief marketing officer, Atmel Corporation. "Arduino platforms with Atmel AVR microcontrollers have opened the world of MCU design to designers of all ages, giving them an easy-to-use and affordable path to get their projects started quickly. Arduino is a trusted community that promotes creative and innovative thinking for anyone that wants to build a project based on a simple platform."
