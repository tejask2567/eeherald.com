                    Semico Research said that the market for optical based MEMS is poised for exponential growth. The MEMS for direct view displays have emerged in addition to MEMS devices for projection. The total market was under $1 billion in 2011, but by 2016 it will reach $10.4 billion.<br><br>MEOMS (Micro Electro-Optical Mechanical System) is a specific form of MEMS in which light is manipulated. There are essentially two classes of MEOMS. One is for projecting images and another is for direct view displays. The projector type of MEOMS use some form of micro-mirror technology that oscillate to direct a light beam. The direct view display devices are an array of elements that control reflected light.<br><br>Semico report answers: Who the key players and technologies for optical MEMS are? Who are some of the emerging players? What advantages do MEMS offer in projection and display? What will drive adoption of MEMS for projection and display?<br><br>Semico examines the key end use markets for MEMS in projection and display. The size and growth rates of end use markets and the MEMS penetration rates are considered in their report.
