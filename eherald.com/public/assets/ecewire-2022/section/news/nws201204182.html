                  <p class="title-text"> FPGA based video analytics solution from Altera and Eutecus for video surveillance systems </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Altera Corporation has announced a new four-channel, standard definition (SD) video analytics solution for digital video recorders (DVRs) and network video recorders (NVRs) for surveillance systems. In association with Eutecus, Altera's video analytics solution allows customers to analyze four D1 480p/30fps (frames-per second) video channels simultaneously using a single FPGA. Customers can add this capability to their existing SD surveillance investment without having to purchase new cameras with integrated analytics.<br><br>Altera's video analytics solution includes a Cyclone IV field programmable gate array and Eutecus' multi-core video analytics engine (MVE) intellectual property (IP) core, which performs the analytics functions in the FPGA. This solution allows designers to replace multiple digital signal processors with a single FPGA.<br><br>Altera's FPGA-based video surveillance solution finds their applications in banking, education, city, industrial, and government and traffic surveillance systems.<br><br>Designers can customize their own video surveillance system by using this FPGA-based video analytics solution. The Eutecus' MVE IP combines parallel algorithms and multi-core coprocessors with multiple Altera Nios II cores integrated into a Cyclone IV FPGA. The solution comes with a software GUI that allows designers to customize the event-detection parameters and rules for their specific applications. The Eutecus' IP includes a robust application programming interface (API) that interfaces with a customer's video management systems or can be used to develop custom GUI solutions.<br><br>"Altera and Eutecus's high performance, low cost and low power FPGA-based video analytics solutions are designed to provide developers of video surveillance systems a flexible platform that allows for end system differentiation," said Jeff Waters, senior vice president of the military, industrial and computing division at Altera. "Giving designers the ability to quickly and easily acquire hardware and IP enables our customers to get to market quickly and to expand their analytics capabilities in existing surveillance equipment."<br><br>"Altera's Cyclone IV FPGA and its Quartus II software environment offer the ideal modular design environment for Eutecus' new generation of MVE solutions," said Csaba Rekeczky, CEO and president of Eutecus. "Video analytics customers can take advantage of the close cooperation between our companies for both single channel IP camera and multi-channel DVR/NVR products by leveraging Eutecus' highly modular, flexible and scalable IP cores and Altera's low-cost, low-power, customizable FPGAs."<br><br>Both the four-channel D1 video analytics solutions and the 1080p HD video analytics solutions are available through Altera. Altera offers a single-vendor source model for the overall video analytics solution. The IP and FPGA can be purchased directly from Altera.
