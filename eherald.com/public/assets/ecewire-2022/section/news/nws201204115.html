                    <p>
                    Rambus has has received a "Best Paper Award" for one of the papers it presented at the recent 2012 DesignCon. The paper, titled, "Design and Characterization of the Power Supply System for a High-speed 1600 Mbps DDR3 Interface in Wirebond Package", was awarded in the DesignCon Board and System Level design category.<br><br>The paper, as presented by Rambus engineers, outlined a supply system design methodology for high-speed interface systems used in the design of a 1600 Mbps DDR3 interface in wirebond package. The paper discusses the power integrity challenges for high-speed memory interfaces and how they require a system-level approach which includes supply noise mitigation. The paper also demonstrated the full spectrum of power integrity considerations typical in the design of high-speed interfaces in order to achieve reliable system performance at high data rates. Rambus also presented a live demonstration of the interface solution within its booth during the DesignCon conference.<br><br>To access the Rambus 2012 DesignCon award-winning paper, visit http://designcon.com/paper_winners
