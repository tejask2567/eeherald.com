                    IHS iSuppli finds rise in average retail pricing for U.S. flat-panel televisions to the highest level in two-and-a-half years during the second quarter of 2012. The features driving the price and growth are 3D, Smart TV and LED backlighted larger screens.<br><br>IHS iSuppli says pricing for U.S. flat-panel televisions reached $1,224 during the second quarter, up a healthy 3 percent from $1,190 in the previous quarter, and up by an even larger 9 percent from $1,124 a year ago in the second quarter of 2011.<br><br>U.S. TV<br><br><br>“The climb in U.S. flat-panel TV prices is attributed to market gains in retail among new sets sporting advanced technologies, such as 3-D, integrated interactivity and light-emitting diode (LED) backlight technology used in LCD TV sets,” said Edward Border, analyst for TV technology at IHS. “Consumers also are buying a larger portion of sets with Web 2.0 features characteristic of Smart TVs. Moreover, some large-sized television models in both the LCD and plasma categories increased their share, contributing to overall growth in pricing.”<br><br>More analysis from IHS iSuppli:<br>3-D on the Rise<br>For instance, 3-D sets’ share of all televisions available at retail ascended to 30.9 percent in the second quarter, up from 27.8 percent in the earlier quarter. A similar increase occurred for Smart TVs, growing to 44.3 percent, up from 40.9 percent; and for LED-backlit LCD sets, rising to 63.5 percent, up from 59.2 percent.<br><br>Among specific set categories, increases also took place in some large sizes between the end of the first quarter and the close of the second.<br><br>The 46-inch LCD’s share in retail rose to 12.2 percent, up from 11.8 percent. Meanwhile, share for the 60-inch LCD increased to 5.2 percent, up from 4.2 percent. Plasma sets saw an even greater expansion, with the 50-inch rising to 23.8 percent, up from 21.2 percent; the 60-inch increasing to 23.6 percent, up from 18.6 percent; and the 65-inch growing to 6.9 percent, up from 6.1 percent.<br><br>Within the LCD TV space, the majority of the smaller, below-42-inch screen sizes saw their average retail price increase, as features including Full HD, LED and Internet connectivity became more widespread in 2012 models.<br><br><br>32-inch Sets See Market Decline<br>One major exception to this trend was the continued price decline of the ever-popular 32-inch TV sector. By the second quarter, the average price of the set was just $435, down from $495 in the first quarter. In another notable development, pricing in June for the 42-inch LCD TV category plunged to an all-time low of $761, down from $807 in May, after two consecutive months of price hikes.<br><br>In the Smart TV sector, average pricing in June fell to $1,907 from $2,015 in May, but it was up significantly compared to $1,724 in June last year. From a pricing perspective then, the Smart TV can be considered a major technological success so far this year, appealing to consumers with its dynamic mix of interactive features, easy integration with set-top boxes, emphasis on online streaming capabilities and access to over-the-top cable content.<br><br>For plasma sets, pricing in the second quarter was up for sizes ranging from the 46-inch to the 60- inch models, retreating only in the 42-inch and 65-inch categories.<br><br>Average pricing in the second quarter for plasma displays as a whole reached $1,628, while that for LCD TVs amounted to $1,120 during the same period.
