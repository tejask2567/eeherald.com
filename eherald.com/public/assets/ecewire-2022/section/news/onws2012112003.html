                    Mentor Graphics has enhanced its online VLSI chip design verification site http://verificationacademy.com/ with the Coverage Cookbook. Verification Academy provides online training on advanced functional verification technologies.<br><br>This first phase of the Coverage Cookbook introduces a methodology focused on coverage that complements the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), an industry standard verification methodology that has gained a significant following over the last several years, as per Mentor. The Coverage Cookbook is a series of online linked articles designed to help you master the methodology and process required to effectively adopt a coverage-driven verification flow by providing:<br>A foundation of understanding on the various types of coverage metrics available today, and how to effectively use them<br>A repeatable process for creating functional coverage models distilled from a specification<br>Real-world examples used to demonstrate the functional coverage modeling process<br><br>“Our focus with the Verification Academy has been on building advanced skills and easy to adopt methodologies so that our customers can get the most out of today’s advanced functional verification techniques,” said Harry Foster, chief scientist for the Design Verification Technology division at Mentor. “Our UVM Cookbook is the most comprehensive resource available today, which provides the methodology necessary for effective constrained-random testbench adoption. We are now excited to announce a new cookbook we call the Coverage Cookbook, which introduces a systematic methodology for developing functional coverage models and coverage-driven processes.”<br><br>“I’m delighted to see the refined website as I feel it is very useful for verification engineers in terms of their day-to-day activities. I find myself visiting the website on a daily basis, reading forums and watching the videos,” said RaviVarma Kanumuri, verification engineer, L&T Infotech. “Overall, I’m very satisfied with the new changes, and look forward to seeing more updates on the latest verification do’s and don’ts for better verification.”<br><br>“Verification Academy is the best web site for learning UVM,” said Allen Shen, senior principal engineer – SoC Verification, Western Digital. “I’ve attended other training sessions on UVM, but they don't compare to this web site.”
