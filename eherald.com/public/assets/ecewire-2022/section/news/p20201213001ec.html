                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    JEDEC published  new version of the removable memory card standard;  JESD220-2B Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Card Extension Standard 3.0. This new version aligned with the popular UFS 3.0 embedded device standard already widely recognized in many high-end mobile and consumer-focused applications. JESD220-2B can be downloaded from the JEDEC website. UFS is suitabe for smartphones, tablets,  automotive and IOT applications, where power consumption need to be minimal. <br><br>Some of the major improvements  in JESD220-2B UFS 3.0 card standard compared to prior version of the Flash memory standard are:<br><br>Significant improvement in  speed to 1.2 Gigabytes per second (GB/s) from a maximum of 600 Megabytes per second (MB/s) for the prior version. <br><br>UFS Card 3.0 enables products to boot more quickly and easily through the use of a UFS Card.<br><br>On the interoperability front, JESD220-2B simplifies selected features, including the removal of features not needed for the removable card such as Product State Awareness (PSA), Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB), Context, Priority of Logical Unit, and Dynamic Capacity. UFS Card 3.0 enables less number of logical units to simplify storage management.<br><br>Data-intensive smartphone applications, Recording data from multiple, hi-resolution video cameras simultaneously (high-end drones, automotive applications), Storage for automotive applications such as infotainment, ADAS, navigation, and black box recordings are some of the examples quoted by JEDEC for the standard.<br><br>“JEDEC’s new UFS card standard offers the same high-end functionality as the highly popular UFS embedded device standard, in a convenient card format that’s well suited for a variety of removable applications,” said Mian Quddus, Chairman of the JEDEC Board of Directors and the JC-64 Committee for Embedded Memory Storage and Removable Memory Cards. He added, “Supporting multiple, simultaneous data-intensive functions on a smartphone, or for use as an easily extendable storage solution within the automotive market, are just two examples of the versatility of UFS Card 3.0.”
