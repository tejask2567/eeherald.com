                  <blockquote>

                    Organic semiconductor material is fast gaining importance in atleast threes areas: LCD displays, LEDs, and PV solar panels. Germany based organic solar innovation company Heliatek GmbH has opened production facility for the manufacturing of organic solar films. To manufacture flexible organic solar PV panels Heliatek has invested €14 million in the construction of its first production line.<br><br>Heliatek says it has developed the world's first manufacturing line producing organic solar panels in a roll-to-roll process using vacuum deposition at low temperatures - a process that holds excellent potential for significantly reducing costs in mass production. While other organic manufacturers rely on printing processes, Heliatek claims it is the only company in the world that specializes in solar panel manufacture using vacuum deposition of small molecules (oligomers) on flexible film. The advantages lie in better process control, higher efficiency, and longer life span, according to Heliatek.<br><br>Thibaud Le Séguillon, CEO of Heliatek GmbH, said: "After a construction period of less than six months of this proof-of-concept production line, we have achieved an important milestone on our way to the commercialization of organic solar films based on small molecules. Now comes process integration. Heliatek will roll out its organic solar film for "Energy-2-Go" applications in the fall of 2012. Key product features will allow us to take truly green solar power everywhere it's needed. At the next step, the first volume market will be BIPV. To support this strategy, we plan to close another round of financing this year, during which we should raise €50 million from current and new investors for an additional production line."<br><br>"Organic photovoltaic is an important next generation technology for BASF," said Dirk Nachtigal, Managing Director of BASF Venture Capital. That's why BASF is developing new organic materials for solar cells that enable efficient and competitive energy generation. "In order to fully exploit the potential of this innovative technology, our collaboration with partners like Heliatek is of strategic importance," continued Nachtigal.<br><br>Heliatek says its ultra-thin and light-weight panels -weighing in at only 500 grams per square meter - can be integrated into the widest range of applications. "I'm convinced that organic photovoltaics will take their rightful position in a highly competitive market, especially in segments in which they can easily play to their strengths. The system constructed by Heliatek offers all the facilities necessary to take advantage of this excellent opportunity," stated Dr. Alexander Flaig, Vice President Corporate Research at the Bosch Group.<br><br>Dr. Christian Reitberger of Wellington Partners commented: " Heliatek can set new standards in the still fast-growing photovoltaic market with its in-house developed production processes."
