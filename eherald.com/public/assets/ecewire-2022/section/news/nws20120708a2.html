                    STMicroelectronics said it has made significant progress on all Sustainability fronts in year 2011, such as Health & Safety, Environmental Protection, Responsible Products, People Development and its Community activities.<br><br>The list of sustainability achievements in 2011 provided by ST includes:<br>Consolidating its position among the industry leaders in safety;<br>Covering more than 83% of ST employees with the Company’s voluntary Health Plan;<br>Recycling more than 40% of all water used at all of its facilities worldwide;<br>Recycling/reusing more than 90% of waste generated at its facilities;<br>Ensuring that 100% of its supply chain exercises care to prevent the use of conflict minerals;<br>Enlarging the scope of its educational activities by initiating, together with a number of other European industrial companies –all members of the ERT3 the Global Enterprise Project, a new initiative that gives young people the opportunity to develop greater understanding about doing business globally while acquiring the skills required to succeed in today’s knowledge-based economy.<br>Introducing many advanced products such as intelligent motor drives specifically designed to minimize energy consumption across the spectrum of electronic applications.<br><br>“The semiconductor industry is increasingly driven by the way people live and what they expect technology to bring to their lives, both in enhancing the quality of the way they work, learn, interact and relax and in helping to address major societal challenges such as energy saving, healthcare and security,” said Carlo Bozotti, President and CEO of ST. “Sustainability is a crucial part of this challenge and we are determined not only to provide innovative solutions in these areas but also to lead by example in the pursuit of enriching sustainable business.”<br><br>ST says it aims to have 100% of new products eco-designed by 2015 and ST says it has made significant progress in 2011 in developing in-house eco-design tools well suited to the complexity of its products. The spearheads in this area are the integration, from the early stages, of environmental parameters in technology and product design, greener material selection and greener packaging, adds ST.<br><br>ST as an early green technology adapter, it is in the forefront as a green semiconductor supplier. Few decades back being green was more of a moral and ethical issue, but now it is bottom line. So whoever has invested earlier in this area, they are reaping benefits now.<br><br>ST has posted the report at url:<br>http://www.st.com/internet/com/about_st/company_reports_st.jsp
