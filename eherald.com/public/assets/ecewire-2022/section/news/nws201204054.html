                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Anritsu has announced that its VectorStar Broadband ME7838A vector network analyzer (VNA) system was used by Modelithics, Inc. to validate the performance of its flip chip Schottky diode model for the W Band Single Anode and W Band Zero Biased Detector Schottky diodes from Virginia Diodes (VDI), Inc.<br><br>The ME7838A VNA was used to make two-port series S-parameter measurements and an on-board probing with calibration reference at the component pad-stacks to validate the model's performance from DC to 125 GHz. The ME7838A was also used to generate ultra-broadband S-parameter data.<br><br>As per the released notes, the ME7838A was chosen because of its wide frequency range measuring from 70 kHz to 125 GHz, its excellent dynamic range, measurement speed, and calibration and measurement stability.<br><br>As per John Fisher, Vice President of Operations at Modelithics, "We are very excited about the technical advances represented by what we believe to be the broadest band non-linear diode models developed to date. The overall performance of the Anritsu ME7838A VNA system allowed us to acquire the 125 GHz broadband data very efficiently to enable advancement of models that not only fit this broadband data set well, but that also provided excellent agreement to independently obtain non-linear harmonic power validations".<br><br>As per Donn Mulder, Anritsu Senior VP and General Manager of the Microwave Measurements Division "The Anritsu VectorStar ME7838A Broadband System helps design and modeling engineers develop and validate advanced developments such as the models from Modelithics. It provides the frequency coverage and measurement capability necessary for verifying the ever-growing complex designs at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies".
