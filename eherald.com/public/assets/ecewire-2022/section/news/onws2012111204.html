                    High-end test and measurement equipment supplier Anritsu Corporation has opened 100% India subsidiary in Bangalore. The new office brings together the functions of marketing, sales, engineering, services, and support. By co-locating all the departments, the company expects to accelerate the rate of delivery of new products and provide better and broader support to its growing customer base in India. It will also plan to start a branch office operation in Noida within this fiscal year.<br><br>“We are pleased to reach the day we open our full-scale presence in India. India’s emerging market is part of our overseas business expansion strategy; the telecommunications industry will witness further growth due to the new telecom policy and will continuously outpace its global counterparts. We foresee India business growth by 20% per cent annually with the increased demand for test & measurement equipments”, said Mr. Kenji Tanaka, Senior Executive Vice President, Anritsu Corporation.<br><br>The Indian test and measurement market has been driven by global and domestic demands. According to Frost & Sullivan research on Indian test & measurement shows that the domestic demands have risen over the years, to make the market realize the opportunities from every sector in India. There has been an increasing integration of internet connectivity, wireless communications (3G/4G/WiFi/Bluetooth), high-fidelity audio and HD video in consumer electronics devices. This has been accelerating the demand for new technology testing solutions.<br><br>“We believe in high-potential growth of the Indian market and are eager to expand our global sales to synchronize their growth by providing the best test & measurement solutions based on our 100 plus years of innovations. Through our stronger presence in India we aim to enhance our sales in the Indian market significantly”, added Mr. Kenji Tanaka, Senior Executive Vice President, Anritsu Corporation.<br><br>Anritsu Corporation has been operating in India since 1980s through its representative liaison offices at first in New Delhi and then in Bangalore. Anritsu Pte Ltd had subsequently established India branch office earlier in 2007 to support the local customers and expand the service support capabilities.<br><br>Its India business has seen a significant growth over the last few years. The customer base has shown significant increase across wireless R&D (3G/4G), telecom operators, network equipment manufacturers & installers, mobile & BTS manufacturing and Defense & Aerospace. Anritsu has plans to expand the Direct and Indirect Sales Network in India to cover all the Segments and Geographies.<br><br>Source: Anritsu
