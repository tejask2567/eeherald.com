                    NPD DisplaySearch has reported tablet shipments to surpass notebook shipments in 2016 and the overall mobile PC shipments are expected to grow from 347M units in 2012 to over 809M units by 2017.<br><br>Further finding shared by NPD DisplaySearch includes:<br>The notebook PC shipments are expected to increase from 208M units in 2012 to 393M units by 2017 and the tablet PC shipments are expected to grow from 121M units to 416M units in this period, for a compound annual growth rate of 28%.<br><br>A key driver for tablet PC growth is adoption in mature markets (including North America, Japan and Western Europe), which accounts for 66% of shipments in 2012 and remain in the 60% range throughout the forecast period. Tablet PC shipments into mature markets are to grow from 80M units in 2012 to 254M units by 2017.<br><br>Figure 1: Worldwide Mobile PC Shipment Forecast (000s)<br><br><br>tablet<br><br><br><br><br>“Consumer preference for mobile computing devices is shifting from notebook to tablet PCs, particularly in mature markets,” said Richard Shim, senior analyst at NPD DisplaySearch. “While the lines between tablet and notebook PCs are blurring, we expect mature markets to be the primary regions for tablet PC adoption. New entrants are tending to launch their initial products in mature markets. Services and infrastructure needed to create compelling new usage models are often better established in mature markets.”<br><br>Figure 2: Emerging and Mature Market Tablet Shipments (000s)<br><br><br>tablet<br><br><br><br>Tablet PCs are built upon convenience-oriented features including instant-on capability, long battery life and extreme portability. They are expected to progress in form factor and performance, making them a compelling alternative to notebook PCs. Tablet PCs are likely to integrate multi-core processors, increasingly stable operating systems, growing app libraries and higher resolution displays.<br><br>Notebook PCs are also evolving to meet the challenge from tablet PCs. Thinner form factors, higher resolution displays and touch functionality features are expected to increase. The notebook PC market is to remain the largest part of the mobile PC market during the estimate period, accounting for 60% of mobile PC shipments in 2012, declining to 49% by 2017.<br><br>The quarterly Mobile PC Shipment and Forecast report offers an objective, expert view of the market with insight into historical shipments, revenues and forecasts with analysis of worldwide and regional brands.<br><br>For more information: www.displaysearch.com
