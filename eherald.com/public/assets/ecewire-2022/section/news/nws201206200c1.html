                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Analog Devices (ADI) and TSMC have collaborated in developing analog process technology platform for precision analog integrated circuits (ICs).<br><br>ADI says the new process technology platform significantly improves analog performance for a number of devices, including A/D and D/A converters, power management devices, and audio coders/decoders that are widely used in consumer, communication, computer, industrial, and automotive applications. Performance enhancements achieved with the 0.18 micron, 5-volt process include an order of magnitude noise improvement, a 70 percent lower standby leakage current, a 50 percent improvement in linearity and a 50 percent better capacitor and resistor matching, according to ADI.<br><br>Recently introduced ADI products developed with the new platform include isolated CAN (control-area network) transceivers; a HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) modem IC; an ECG (electrocardiogram) AFE (analog front-end); a series of digital potentiometers, and an audio codec.<br><br>“The close, long-term technology relationship between Analog Devices and TSMC has enabled the development of this new industry-leading analog technology platform,” said David Robertson, vice president, Analog Technology, Analog Devices. “The combination of an optimized process along with circuit and architecture innovation is key for our high-performance converter and linear products. This TSMC process provides a valuable addition to ADI’s process technology portfolio.”<br><br>“ADI has worked with TSMC since the 0.6-micron and 0.35-micron analog processes,” said Rick Cassidy, president, TSMC North America. “Our collaboration on this important, new platform demonstrates the ADI/TSMC commitment to specialty technology development, and the great number of applications these improved products will enable.”
