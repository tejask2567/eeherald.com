                    STMicroelectronics got its 28nm FD-SOI fab production ready at Crolles (France) 300mm manufacturing facility. ST can leverage this fab to make its SoC semiconductor chips for consumer electronics and portable/mobile convergence market.<br><br>ST said its FD-SOI technology has already been selected by ST-Ericsson for use in its future mobile platforms, which will enable enhanced performance with significantly lower power consumption than conventional technologies.<br><br>“ST has a long history in pioneering new solutions in both product and technology. By bringing FD-SOI technology to manufacturing readiness, ST is again positioning itself as an innovator and leader in semiconductor technology development and manufacturing,” said Jean-Marc Chery, Executive Vice President, General Manager Digital Sector, and Chief Technology and Manufacturing Officer of STMicroelectronics. “Post-processing wafer testing has allowed us to prove the significant performance and power advantages of FD-SOI over conventional technologies, building a cost-effective industrial solution that is available from the 28nm node. Measurements on a multi-core subsystem in an ST-Ericsson NovaThor ModAp platform, with a maximum frequency exceeding 2.5Ghz and delivering 800 MHz at 0.6V, are confirming expectations and demonstrating the great flexibility of the technology and the extended voltage range exploitable through DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling),” concluded Chery.<br><br>ST says it has found porting Libraries and Physical IPs from 28nm Bulk CMOS to 28nm FD-SOI to be straightforward, and the process of designing digital SoCs with conventional CAD tools and methods in FD-SOI to be identical to Bulk, due to the absence of MOS-history-effect.
