                    Cypress Semiconductor is finally successful in acquiring FRAM specialist Ramtron. As per the agreement, Cypress to acquire all outstanding stock of Ramtron at a price of $3.10 per share in cash. The transaction, valued at approximately $109.8 million (excluding assumed debt and options and including shares previously acquired by Cypress), represents a premium of 71% to Ramtron’s closing price of $1.81 per share on June 11, 2012, the day before Cypress publicly disclosed its offer for Ramtron. The Boards of Directors of both Cypress and Ramtron have approved the transaction. Ramtron’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Ramtron stockholders tender their shares in Cypress’s increased tender offer.<br><br>“We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Ramtron,” said T.J. Rodgers, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cypress. “Ramtron and its employees have done an impressive job building a valuable technology base, providing the market with a full portfolio of innovative, low-power, nonvolatile memory solutions.”<br><br>“The combination of Ramtron’s FRAM technology with Cypress’s nvSRAM business, considerable R&D resources, historically strong manufacturing capabilities, global sales organization, and deep extension into distribution channels will create a significant new entity in the nonvolatile memory business. We look forward to working with Ramtron to complete the transaction quickly, enabling a seamless transition for customers and business partners once the transaction is complete,” Rodgers concluded.<br><br>“Through the strategic alternative review process, the Ramtron Board sought to determine a course of action that would enable Ramtron stockholders to fully realize the value inherent in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Ultimately, the Board concluded that a combination with Cypress accomplishes that objective, and believes the transaction represents a positive outcome for Ramtron stockholders, customers, partners and employees,” said Dr. William G. Howard, Ramtron Chairman.
