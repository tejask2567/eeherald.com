                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    TrendForce has projected in 2012 smartphone shipments to reach 606 million units, a 31.6% increase compared to last year; tablet shipments are forecast at 94 million units, a 69% increase. Desktops and notebooks are expected to see less than 5% yearly shipment growth, to 146 million and 206 million, respectively, as per TrendForce.<br><br>TrendForce says the arrival of the new tablet named Surface from Microsoft has important implications for both Microsoft and the media tablet ecosystem. The tablet market is shaping up for a three-way battle between Apple, Google, and Microsoft, quote TrendForce.<br><br>TrendForce believes the following strengths will enable Windows Phone 8 to compete against Android-based smartphones: 1. WP8 upgrades are easier than Android upgrades; 2. Fewer compatibility issues for OEMs to work out, as WP8 specifies hardware requirements just as its Windows 8 big brother does for PCs; 3. WP8 provides a standardized consumer experience, whereas Android’s highly customizable nature results in wide variation between different devices. Therefore, although the development schedule for WP8 is behind that of its competitors, the standardization of Microsoft’s product lowers software development costs, which will in turn help increase WP8 market share.
