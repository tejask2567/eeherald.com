                    <p>
                    Semiconductor business of Samsung Electronics has announced production of its new powerful ARM Cortex-A9 processor core based SoC chip Exynos-4 quad for powering Samsung's Galaxy series of smart phones (Samsung Galaxy S III) and also for the tablet computers. The Exynos -4 quad has quad-core Application Processor.<br><br>This chip is made using 32nm low power High K Metal Gate (HKMG) semiconductor chip making process. The quad-core Application processor allots separate cores for video playback, net surfing, and also a virus scan in progress. 3D gaming going to be smoother due to multi-core. Also editing of picture and video is expected to be smoother.<br><br>Each core can be switched on-off based on the need. The power is consumed based on the task and the speed of operation by applying different voltages to reduce power consumption.<br><br>Exynos 4 Dual consumes 20 percent less power compared to the present Exynos processor chip.<br>This chip is also designed to be package and pin-to-pin compatible with the previous versions of Exynos chip, so that the phone makers no need to redesign the PCB and the other circuit resulting in saving of design and manufacturing cost of smart phone.<br><br>The application processor is designed to consume very low power while doing multi-tasking resulting in improved battery life. This chip nearly offers a performance of PC in a phone.<br><br>Exynos 4 Quad is optimized for a dedicated power management chip (PMIC, Power Management Integrated Circuit) S5M8767.<br><br>Benefits to the mobile phone user include: HD video playing without encoding, Digital still camera like picture taking ability, and console like 3D gaming.<br><br>The next version of Exynos is expected to be a dual core but powered by the even more powerful ARM Cortex A15 operating at 2 GHz speed, as per internet sources.<br><br>To know more visit:<br><br>http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/products4quad.html
