                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    DisplaySearch has reported shipments of 3D LCD TV panels spiked to 7.8 million in Q4'11, up 26% Q/Q. As a result, total 3D TV panel shipments in 2011 reached 21.2 million, accounting for 10% of all LCD TV panels shipped According to the NPD DisplaySearch Quarterly Large-Area TFT LCD Shipment Report - Advanced LED + 3D, panel makers are targeting very strong growth of 138% for 2012, which would lead to 3D LCD TV panel shipments of 50 million units, for a penetration rate of 21.6% of all LCD TV panel shipments.<br><br>"As brands continue to promote 3D, end-user awareness and interest is growing. While there are still concerns about the lack of 3D content and services, as well as end-users' needs, LCD TV panel makers have pushed 3D capability via lower prices and the introduction of new, cost-effective technologies," noted David Hsieh, Vice President, Greater China Market for NPD DisplaySearch. Hsieh added, "Many TV brands have started to list 3D as a basic feature for their models above a certain level. This, along with reduction in 3D panel premiums, will be the main driver for 3D penetration in TV panels. Meanwhile, improvements in patterned retarder film manufacturing and lamination stability will increase output through yield rate enhancement."<br><br>Other findings and analysis reported by DisplaySearch:<br>According to the report, shutter glass technology use is still larger than patterned retarder technology, with 6.2% penetration in total LCD TV panel shipments in 2011, with patterned retarder accounting for 3.9%. According to the NPD DisplaySearch estimates of panel makers' shipment targets, 2012 penetration rates will increase to 11.6% for shutter glass type and 10.0% for pattern retarder type.<br><br>In addition to TV, panel makers are aggressively promoting 3D monitor panels, especially for consumer entertainment and gaming PCs. In 3D LCD monitor panels, pattern retarder manufacturers are more aggressive than shutter glass makers. Panel makers are targeting shipments of more than 1.5 million per quarter from Q2'12 onward. This is up from 235K in Q4'11.<br><br>Electronics Engineering Herald<br>Source: DisplaySearch Quarterly Large-Area TFT LCD Shipment Report - Advanced LED + 3D
