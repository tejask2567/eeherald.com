                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Breker Verification Systems has announced that its TrekSoC software has been selected by STMicroelectronics’ Automotive Product Group (APG) to automate the generation of self-verifying C test cases for multi-threaded system-on-chip (SoC) devices to validate the design of its powertrain engine control unit.<br><br>The group based in Milan, Italy selected TrekSoC after a detailed evaluation of its efficiency, quality and productivity. The current verification environment for the automotive chips includes the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) with an internal standard C-application programming interface (API). C test cases are generated by TrekSoC to run on the chip’s embedded processor and stress the design in RTL simulation as well as on a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based prototyping platform.<br><br>The methodology team within STMicroelectronics Functional Verification Group in Grenoble, France, has been a long-time user of TrekSoC.<br><br>“Quality and reliability are critical components of STMicroelectronics’ products, especially in the automotive sector,” said Giorgio Mastrorocco, front-end design methodologies principal engineer, Digital Products R&D, STMicroelectronics APG. “As one of the world’s top automotive semiconductor suppliers, and a leader in quality, safety and sustainability, we are always looking for tools and methodologies to further improve our products and have adopted TrekSoC because it has proven effective in meeting our challenges.”
