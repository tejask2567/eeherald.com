                    <p>
                    Honeywell has reminded technical students in colleges and universities across the world to submit their abstracts for the annual Honeywell students' competition. Students are invited to propose ideas on ways to advance innovation in the process automation industry.<br><br>"Student competitions such as this serve two critical purposes," said Darius Adamczyk, president of Honeywell process solutions. "First, they bring fresh thinking that help solve real problems faced by real manufacturing facilities. And second, they show the innovators of tomorrow how they can put their engineering skills to use in the real world, strengthening our future workforce."<br><br>Honeywell's UniSim design suite is an sensitive and interactive process model to create steady state and dynamic models for plant design, performance monitoring, troubleshooting, operational improvement, business planning, and asset management. Using this suite, the students need to create and demonstrate the process aimed at solving a critical plant business issue. The business issues can be improving efficiency, productivity, reliability, safety, sustainability, etc.,<br><br>Each winner from each region and their research advisor will be invited to present their design at the 2012 Honeywell users' group conference in their region: Americas (Phoenix, June 10-15), Asia-Pacific (Gold Coast, Australia, August 5-9) or EMEA (Istanbul, Turkey, November 13-16). Honeywell will cover travel, accommodation and registration costs. The sponsoring tutor will also have the chance to attend a highly in-depth and informative training course at one of Honeywell's automation colleges.<br><br>Abstracts covering the benefits derived from the design should be approximately 300 words in length and should be accompanied with a short presentation.<br>The last date for submission is:<br><br>1. Americas: 4 May 2012<br>2. Asia-Pacific: 30 April 2012<br>3. EMEA: 30 August 2012
