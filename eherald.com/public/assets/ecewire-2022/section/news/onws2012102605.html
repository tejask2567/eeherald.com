                  <p class="title-text"> Mobiveil to add support for the RapidIO 10xN specs to its SRIO digital IP controllers </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Mobiveil, Inc. plans to add support for the third-generation RapidIO 10xN specification to its 2.2-compliant Serial RapidIO (SRIO) Digital IP controllers. Mobiveil's RapidIO Controller is part of its High speed Serial Interconnect family of IP solutions that also includes Gen3 PCI Express, 1G, and 10G Ethernet MACs, SPI4.2 and PCI Express Bridge and Switch solutions.<br><br>Ravi Thummarukudy, CEO of Mobiveil, said, "There is a strong need for technology that addresses the high-bandwidth requirements of the cutting-edge wireless technologies in 4G and beyond. Adoption of the 10xN specification by the RapidIO Trade Association and its support by our Serial RapidIO controller IP helps meet these market requirements. Mobiveil's RapidIO controller technology offers a flexible architecture that optimizes link utilization, latency, reliability, power consumption and silicon footprint in a way that caters to different wireless and wire-line system design requirements. We see tremendous opportunities for our technology through our participation in the RapidIO Trade Association."<br><br>"We are extremely happy to work with Mobiveil and appreciate their contributions to the RapidIO community by providing proven RapidIO-based controllers to the market," said Sam Fuller, Executive Director of the RapidIO Trade Association. He added, "With the introduction of 10xN, RapidIO extends its processor fabric to offer per-port performance that easily scales from 10 Gbps to 160 Gbps. RapidIO is uniquely designed to directly connect processing and I/O devices in a low-latency, deterministic fabric with multiple important communication and high-performance embedded applications."<br><br>Mobiveil's RapidIO IP is available with a native flexible bus interface and also supports a scalable AXI bus interface to support direct connectivity with integrated ARM CPU cores. The Mobiveil RapidIO core features full support for load, store operations, DMA operations, Type 9 Data streaming, Mailbox, CRF, and Flow control capabilities. RapidIO also supports interoperability with standard multiprocessing APIs such as RDMA, MPI, and MCAPI.
