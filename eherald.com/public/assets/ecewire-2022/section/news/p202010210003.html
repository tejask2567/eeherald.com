                    Digi-Key Electronics along with Efficient Power Conversion hosting  webinar on application of eGaN FETS and Ics for motor drives. The webinar will take place on October 28 at 8 a.m. PST.<br><br>The webinar will be presented by Alex Lidow, CEO and co-founder of Efficient Power Conversion Corporation (EPC),  who also penned a book on this subject. GaN FETs improve motor drives by making them smaller, lighter, more precise systems. Attendees will review some key applications using these systems including e-mobility, cobots and robots, DC servo drives, drones and automotive.<br><br>"We are excited to partner with the leading experts at EPC to share this incredibly relevant content with our customers,"? said David Stein, vice president of global supplier management at Digi-Key. "As GaN power technology continues to play a more dominant role as a future solution for power transistors, we are glad to both provide our customers with the knowledge and resources, as well as the widest selection of products and components available in today's market."?<br><br>Attendee can get an inside look at a Field Application Engineering Lab in Italy where Marco Palma will give attendees a demonstration of a GaN-based motor drive.<br><br>"Digi-Key has been a fantastic supporter and partner of EPC and our eGaN products from day one of our commercial launch more than ten years ago,"? said Alex Lidow, CEO of EPC."We are thrilled to collaborate with them to bring this webinar focused on GaN solutions for motor drive applications to the engineering community, furthering our collective mission to assist our customers in extracting the full capabilities of eGaN FETs and Ics in their designs."?
