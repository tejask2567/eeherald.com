                    <p>
                    Fujitsu Semiconductor to transfer ownership of its LSI assembly and test facilities belonging to Fujitsu Integrated Microtechnology Limited (FIM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu Semiconductor, to J-Devices. This step is taken by Fujitsu in its effort to become fab-lite.<br><br>In accordance with the agreement signed by both Fujitsu and J-Devices, by the end of this year ownership of FIM's Miyagi Plant and Aizu Plant is scheduled to be transferred to J-Devices, which will then take over the operation of these manufacturing facilities. All employees of the two plants are expected to be transferred to J-Devices. In addition, FIM plans a staged transfer of equipment from its Kyushu Plant to J-Devices facilities also located in Kyushu, and ultimately will transfer all of its manufacturing capability. After the transfer is complete, the manufacturing currently conducted at FIM's Kyushu Plant will take place with the same high standards for quality at J-Devices' facilities. Employees of FIM's Kyushu Plant are scheduled to be transferred to J-Devices or reassigned within the Fujitsu Group.
