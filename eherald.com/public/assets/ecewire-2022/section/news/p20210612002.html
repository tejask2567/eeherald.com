                    Gartner reports global smartphone sales to end users grew 26% in the first quarter of 2021, with overall worldwide mobile phone sales to end users grew 22% year over year compared to 2020,  year in which a negative growth in smart phone sales was seen.<br><br>“The improvement in consumer outlook, sustained learning and working from home, along with pent-up demand from 2020 boosted sales of smartphones in the first quarter. Consumers started spending on discretionary items as the pandemic situation improved in many parts of the world and markets opened up,” said Anshul Gupta, senior research director at Gartner. “However, one cannot ignore that the base for comparison is also lower in 2020, than it was in 2019. This explains the double-digit growth.” <br><br>Due to the early shipping of 5G smartphones and also due to the launch of midpriced (Rs. 10,000 to 15,000) smartphones, Samsung increased its unit sales globally and maintained its top position. <br><br>Below in the table you can find the leading smartphone vendors in the first quarter of 2021.<br><br><br><img src = "../../images/topsmartphonegartner.png" alt= "SMARTPHONE MARKET 2021" class = "responsive"><br><br><br>Apple slipped to second position in first quarter of 2021, from its position of number one spot in fourth quarter of 2020. The launch of 5G iPhone boosting the sales of Apple. <br><br>As you see in the table above the top five global smartphone vendors registered strong year over year growth over 2020 indicating that the phone market is consolidating around the top five vendors, as per Gartner. Chinese smartphone vendors Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo witnessed growing demand for 5G smartphones and capitalized on the opportunities due to weakening sales of Huawei and LG globally in this quarter, says Gartner.<br><br>Although global chip shortage has hit other industries such as automotive, the smartphone industry is saved from that shortage until now, but the things may change in future where demand for chips may drives the shortage and lead to increase in the selling price of smart phones.
