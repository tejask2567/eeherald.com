                    <p>
                    STATS ChipPAC Ltd. has reached the production milestone of one billion copper wirebond units shipped.<br><br>“We have reached a number of technology and manufacturing achievements in our copper wire packaging roadmap that have enabled us to serve the needs of our diverse customer base and support the acceleration of our copper wire program as more and more customers experience the benefits and reliability of copper wire interconnect as an alternative to gold. Today, we are actively qualifying and ramping to production a wide range of advanced multi-die laminate and leaded packages as well as thermally enhanced mold compounds compatible with copper wire to further increase thermal performance. We are in volume production with copper wirebond devices down to the 40 nanometer (nm) silicon wafer node and are qualified on the 28nm wafer node,” said Wan Choong Hoe, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, STATS ChipPAC.<br><br>STATS ChipPAC explains: Copper wire provides better conductivity than gold, improved electrical and thermal performance, and stronger mechanical properties. With the semiconductor industry trend moving towards higher pin counts, finer bond pad pitches and thinner wire diameters, there is a growing demand to utilize copper wire in more advanced multi-die laminate and leaded packages including three dimensional (3D) packaging.<br><br>“The one billionth copper wire production unit is an important milestone for STATS ChipPAC and our copper wire customers. We are pleased to support our customers with a robust, cost effective solution that offers yield, quality and reliability equal to or better than gold. The proven reliability and continuous development of our copper wirebond manufacturing process has resulted in more customers partnering with STATS ChipPAC as they transition to copper wire interconnect across a wide range of devices and packaging technologies in mobile, consumer and computing applications,” said Hal Lasky, Executive Vice President and Chief Sales Officer, STATS ChipPAC.
