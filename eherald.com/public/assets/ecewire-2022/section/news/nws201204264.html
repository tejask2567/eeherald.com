                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Maxim Integrated Products has announced that its G3-PLC protocol has been recommended as one of the communications platforms that Japanese electrical utilities should use for communication between a smart meter and a home energy management system (HEMS) in home area networks (HANs).<br><br>The Smart house standardization study group, sponsored by Japan's ministry of economy, trade, and industry (METI) has recommended Maxim's protocol.<br><br>Maxim developed the G3-PLC specification in partnership with Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF) and Sagemcom to promote open-endedness and inter-operability among smart grid implementations.<br><br>G3-PLC supports the IPv6 internet protocol to allow new internet based energy management systems. The specification supports two-way communication for demand response and other smart grid applications. G3-PLC was recently established as an ITU communications standard and used as the basis for the IEEE 1901.2 PLC standard. The protocol is already approved for use in neighborhood area network (NAN) and HAN applications in various countries, including the U.S., France, Spain, Taiwan, and the Netherlands.<br><br>"G3-PLC will enable Japanese utilities to design smart grid networks that they can source from multiple manufacturers. It will also let Japanese customers set up next-generation, energy-management control systems in their homes," said Michael Navid, executive business manager for Maxim's powerline products. "G3-PLC will definitely help Japanese consumers better understand and conserve their energy usage," Navid added.
