                    <p>
                    CEVA has joined the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Foundation. CEVA said it will offer its vast expertise in DSP integration and programming for the benefit of heterogeneous architectures composed of CPUs, GPUs and special purpose processors, and collaborate with other HSA members to push forward innovations in mobile and embedded computing.<br><br>CEVA explains: By improving the hardware interfaces, high-level computing language and software application programming interfaces (APIs) between the many components in modern heterogeneous SoCs, the workload can be distributed across the various processors more efficiently, resulting in significant improvements in performance, power efficiency and lower overheads for memory transfer and data bandwidth. The common specification will allow system engineers take full advantage of CEVA's imaging and vision technologies, including the CEVA-MM3101 platform, in heterogeneous architectures for a broad range of applications, including image enhancements, object tracking, augmented reality and natural user interface.<br><br>The HSA (Heterogeneous System Architecture) Foundation goal is to make it easy to program for parallel computing.
