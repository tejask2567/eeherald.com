                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    The top 20 companies by sales revenue in 2012 are estimated by IC Insights in this following order: Intel, Samsung, TSMC, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, Renesas, SK Hynix, Micron, STMicroelectronics, Broadcom, Sony, AMD, Infineon, GlobalFoundries, Fujitsu, NXP, Freescale, and UMC.<br><br>The growth rates are widely varies for top semiconductor vendors. By growth rate IC Insights ranks top 20 as: GlobalFoundries, Qualcomm, TSMC, Nvidia, Broadcom, NXP, Sony, Micron, Intel, UMC, Fujitsu, SK Hynix, Texas Instruments, Renesas, Samsung, Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba, Freescale, and AMD.<br><br>The other market research findings disclosed by IC Insights include:<br><br>Three pure-play foundries are expected to be in the top 20 ranking of leading semiconductor suppliers in 2012 (Figure 1). Combined, these three foundries are forecast to log a 16% increase in 2012/2011 sales, quite impressive considering the expected 2% decline in the worldwide semiconductor market this year. With the continued success of the fabless companies as well as the strong movement by many IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturers like TI, Renesas, ST, etc.) to the fab-lite business model, IC Insights expects the IC foundries to witness very strong demand for their services over the next few years.<br><br>In total, the top 20 semiconductor suppliers are forecast to register a 1% decline in sales this year (about $3.2 billion), one point better than the rate of decline expected for the total worldwide semiconductor market in 2012. The only expected movement with regard to the top 5 spots in the 2012 ranking is that fabless supplier Qualcomm is forecast to register a 30% surge in sales this year and move up three positions to replace TI as the fourth largest semiconductor supplier. In contrast, Freescale is forecast to register a 14% decline in semiconductor revenue this year and drop down three positions from 16th in 2011 to 19th in the 2012 ranking.
