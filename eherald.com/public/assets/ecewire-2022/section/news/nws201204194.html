                    ANT Wireless has announced that ANT+ Alliance member BODY BIKE sets new indoor cycling standards with integrated, accurate measurement of cycling performance. Utilizing ANT+ sensors that link with their ANT+ enabled console, riders can now track real-time power and other key data.<br>The advanced BODY BIKE Connect indoor cycle is designed to measure wattage while peddling and wirelessly syncs with ANT+ bike cadence and heart rate monitors. The combined system also presents data on relative VO2 max, calories, distance, and average, percentage and maximum values. The BODY BIKE performance console accommodates for individual settings. In addition, the available ANT+ hardware accessory will link the data to the iPhone and iPad.<br>"There is no question that measuring bike power greatly enhances performance and results," stated Hanne Sørensen, project manager, BODY BIKE. "We're excited to offer the 1st indoor cycle bike with built in power sensors and ANT+ made this connectivity possible."<br>"BODY BIKE now gives cyclists the most advanced data while staying committed to offering the premium cycling experience," added Paul Lockington, sales manager, Dynastream. "ANT+ provides the bi-directional communication support that this use case demands."<br>BODY BIKE will demonstrate their BODY BIKE Connect at the following industry shows this month:<br>· FIBO, Essen, Germany, April 19-22, hall 2, booth no.
