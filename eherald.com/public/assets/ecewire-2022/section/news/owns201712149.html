                    US based Altair Engineering in collaboration with BMS college of Engineering is setting up Centre of excellence within the college campus of BMS college of Engineering in Bangalore. This CoE to help students to learn simulation and modelling using Altair's solidThinking Activate, and solidThinking Embed, leveraging the IOT platform Carriots IOT/Analytics and building the digital twin as 3D systems using the other tools from the overall HyperWorks software suite. <br><br>Speaking on the collaboration, Pavan Kumar, Managing Director, Altair India, says “We are happy to collaborate with BMS college of Engineering. This is a unique initiative - an attempt in executing sponsored / internship projects on Solid Thinking Compose with respect to math modelling and system based modelling thus giving students and faculty members opportunity and exposure on industry oriented practices, case studies, examples.  Altair, while focusing on building competency on the tool, will also identify and work towards the possibility of outsourcing development work to BMS Information Science and Engineering’ department (IS Dept.) based on Faculty competency. We look forward to more such tie ups with Educational Institutes in the future. This would be Altair's contribution towards educating and up-skilling the next-gen Engineers with modelling -design processes with the help of our products and solutions"<br><br>“In the present era of technology, Machine Learning provides unbound opportunities for students both in career opportunities and higher educational pursuits. Altair Engineering is one of the leading firms in developing products and solutions in the area of Machine Learning.  I am sure our collaboration with Altair Engineering would achieve the desired results” says Dr. K. Mallikharjuna Babu, Principal, BMS College of Engineering<br><br>The students to benefit by Compose Machine Learning related projects, which in turn facilitates them for internship and recruitment at Altair and further at its customers.
