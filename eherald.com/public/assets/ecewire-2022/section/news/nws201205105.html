                    <p>
                    DEKRA has extended its strategic alliance with EPEAT. DEKRA is now recognized as an EPEAT product registration entity.<br><br>DEKRA experts provide the necessary training and advisory activities to the electronic manufacturers as well as evaluate their products for conformance with the worldwide IEEE standards. They also help manufacturers register with EPEAT.<br><br>EPEAT is the evaluation system for the environmental performance of electronic products, capturing 22 percent of the world market for computers in 2010. The evaluation addresses the disposal of toxic substances, environmentally friendly design, an optimised lifetime, recycling and energy efficiency among other measures.<br><br>DEKRA has supported EPEAT with its network of local EPEAT experts in Europe, South America and China. Now, as an official product registration entity (PRE), DEKRA extends the verification and testing capacity of the non-profit US organisation.<br><br>"For an increasing number of purchasers in public authorities and companies, the environmental performance of a product is an important decision criterion", explains Stan Zurkiewicz, GM of DEKRA testing & certification China in Guangzhou. "To the extent that we confirm conformance with the objective, transparent and strict EPEAT standards, we also support the expansion of the standard and ensure manufacturers of green products are rewarded for their efforts in the marketplace".<br><br>"Since 2011, our strategic partnership with DEKRA has enabled EPEAT to train additional manufacturers, purchasers and verifiers around the globe in the fundamentals of our standards and procedures", says Robert Frisbee, CEO of EPEAT, Inc. "With this new level of co-operation, we are further accelerating the expansion of EPEAT and guaranteeing the long-term credibility of the system".
