                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    AdaCore has announced that SmartSide has implemented the Ada programming language and AdaCore’s GNAT Pro development environment for the implementation of their Smart devices platform. SmartSide offers multi-energy meter data management systems. Distribution network operators use SmartSide technology to optimize their Smart Grid networks through the Smart Energy Core platform.<br><br>“In our relentless search for quality and performance, Ada has come up as the most efficient technology for writing reliable, secure and scalable code that is also easily maintainable,” said David Dhénaux, SmartSide CTO. “GNAT Pro is our framework of choice for writing Ada code. Its all-in-one development environment allows us to handle activities ranging from initial development to static analysis and testing. It reduces our time-to-market and gives us the edge we need in today’s competitive environment. We also selected AdaCore for the high quality and responsiveness of its support team. Finally, we chose to work with AdaCore because their product roadmap is particularly well-suited to ours, with tools and language evolution focused on reliability.”<br><br>The two primary components of the system are<br>1. The generic core, which acts as the intelligence of the system and performs the major work (data collection, processing, analysis). This part of the system is generic and configurable to process all kinds of energy and environmental data.<br>2. The user interfaces, which are separate from the core, are flexible and easy to adapt.<br><br>The infrastructure of the Smart Devices platform is designed to be scalable, reliable and fault resistant. GNAT Pro and the Ada programming language were chosen because of their experience in the aerospace and defense industries.
