                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    U.S. based world's premier institute MIT has launched online course for free as part of its online learning initiative called "MITx.". The first prototype course is on "Circuits and Electronics.". Interested students are asked to sign up for the course at mitx.mit.edu. The course will officially begin on March 5 and run through June 8.<br><br>This course coded as 6.002x will introduce engineering in the context of the lumped circuit abstraction, helping students to make the transition from physics to the fields of electrical engineering and computer science. The teachers include Indian origin Anant Agarwal, EECS professor and director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Chris Terman, CSAIL co-director; EECS Professor Gerald Sussman; and CSAIL Research Scientist Piotr Mitros. When FAQs on this course is read, we learned this course is open to all but suggest requirement of some skills. The title of the course suggests background of physic and mathematics. It can also be a refresher course for electronics engineers who want to refresh electronic circuit design knowledge. Check this url on FAQs: http://mitx.mit.edu/6002x-faq.html.<br><br>After logging into mitx.mit.edu, students can find course schedule, an e-textbook for the course, and a discussion board. Every week students can watch video lectures and demonstrations, work with practice exercises, complete homework assignments, and participate in an online interactive lab specifically designed to replicate its real-world counterpart. Students also take exams and are able to check their grades as they progress in the course. Students are expected to spend approximately 10 hours each week on the course.<br><br>At the end of the course, students who demonstrate their mastery will be able to receive a certificate of completion for free. But to receive the credential, students are charged with modest fee.
