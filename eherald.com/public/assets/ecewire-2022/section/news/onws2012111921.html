                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Infineon's popular 32 bit MCUs based on its proprietary architecture called TriCore reaches 100 million by shipment. TriCore is used in engine control and body electronics of cars and other automotives extensively due to the high-reliability and better performance compared to other MCUs in the market. Basically these low power MCUs are used to consume less fuel in petrol/diesel cars and also popular in electric cars.<br><br>Peter Schäfer, Infineon's general manager of microcontrollers said: "Our TriCore microcontrollers with embedded flash have been in series production for engine control units since 2005. The devices are assembled in over fifty automotive brands. Statistically speaking, this means that almost every second vehicle produced today includes a TriCore based mcu."
