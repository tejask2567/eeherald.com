                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Carbon Design Systems Inc and Imagination Technologies have announced that a wide range of Imagination's PowerVR, Ensigma and Meta intellectual property (IP) cores will be available as 100% accurate virtual models from Carbon's IP Exchange web portal www.carbonipexchange.com.<br><br>With the approval of Carbon and Imagination, the users of Carbon's SoCDesigner Plus virtual platform can request and download the models from the portal and then drop them directly onto the design canvas. Models will enable architectural analysis, pre-silicon firmware development and other system design tasks that benefit from design accuracy.<br><br>"Our customers are telling us that the multimedia, processor and communications features of their system on chip offerings play a huge role in product differentiation," remarked Bill Neifert, chief technical officer at Carbon Design Systems. "Virtual models of IP from Imagination Technologies on Carbon IP Exchange will enable SoC designers to gain the benefits from virtual platforms that had previously been confined to processor and memory subsystems."<br><br>"We recognize that a growing number of our licensees and partners are working to create ever more advanced virtual SoC prototypes containing models of our IP when implementing advanced SoC designs," commented Tony King-Smith, vice president of marketing at Imagination Technologies. "By partnering with Carbon Design Systems to make virtual models of our IP available on request on Carbon's portal, we are enabling more of our users to benefit from this proven design methodology. We're also pleased to welcome Carbon into Imagination's growing engineering ecosystem community."<br><br>Carbon's 100% accurate virtual models of Imagination Technologies' IP are available on request for users of Carbon's SoCDesigner Plus virtual prototype solution who are already licensees of Imagination's IP cores. Models will be implemented by Carbon using master data supplied by Imagination, once approval has been received by Carbon from Imagination for each request.<br><br>The supported IP models are:<br>1. PowerVR Series5, Series5XT and Series6 family of Graphics Processing Units (GPU)<br>2. PowerVR Series3 VXD and VXE families of video decoders and encoders<br>3. Ensigma Series3 UCCP family of multi-standard receivers and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity<br>4. Meta Series2 hardware multi-threaded SoC processors<br><br>The models are available at www.carbonipexchange.com
