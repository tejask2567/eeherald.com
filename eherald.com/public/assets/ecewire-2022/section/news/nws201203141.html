                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Riber has signed an agreement with imec to further collaborate in the field of advanced channel materials for high-performance CMOS scaling using germanium and compound semiconductor (III-V) materials.<br><br>Riber and imec are working in effective passivation techniques for Ge and GaAs.<br>In the new project, the suitability of Riber's 300 mm UHV chamber (ISA300), equipped with in-situ tools for surface analysis, and clustered with state-of-the-art 300mm Si CMOS production equipment to be evaluated for the production of advanced CMOS devices based on high-mobility Ge and IIIV channels. The aim of the project is 1) use Riber's UHV chamber for study and control of surface structures; 2) bring knowledge on gate stack passivation from a 200mm research environment to a 300mm fab compatible platform; 3) demonstrate the technological viability of a 300mm MBE-module, clustered with 'standard' 300mm Si CMOS production equipment.<br><br>Frédérick Goutard, Riber CEO said: "Participating in early stage research is intrinsic to Riber's aim to strengthen our leading position in the compound semiconductor industry. Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is considered to be most efficient technology to leverage compound semiconductors towards high-end applications with a tremendous market potential, such as mobile phones, telecom, automotive, satellite, .... Using our ISA300 chamber in a 300mm cluster configuration will allow for higher performance in terms of devices operating at high frequencies with reduced energy consumption, etc. We are therefore convinced that this project will clearly demonstrate the attractiveness of our technology in the production of next generations CMOS devices."<br><br>Hans Lebon VP fab operations and process step R&D at imec said: "Through the collaboration with Riber, imec can integrate the power of UHV-systems into state-of-the-art semiconductors production equipment on large diameter wafers. This will allow the application of powerful in-situ surface analysis tools in CVD and ALD equipment which so far was not feasible due to the gas phase environment. Also, MBE-like UHV-techniques for interface control and passivation come in reach which will benefit the development of next generation CMOS technologies."
