                    <p>
                    eSolar and Sanmina-SCI have partnered to leverage their respective expertise in solar thermal energy solutions, local content-optimized component design, and manufacturing to offer industry-leading cost and value for utility-scale power plants.<br><br>eSolar, the provider of modular, scalable concentrating solar power (CSP) plant technology, and Sanmina-SCI, an integrated manufacturing services company, will work to optimize eSolar's solar collector system product offering - a system already deployed in operating CSP facilities.<br><br>"Sanmina-SCI's global reach perfectly match eSolar's demonstrated advantage in simple, reliable hardware and industry-leading system software. As we continue to pursue large-scale solar projects worldwide, we need a partner who will optimize our products for manufacturability, scalability and cost-efficiency," said Gary Breton, senior vice president of operations for eSolar. "Their expertise will enable manufacturing cost reductions allowing eSolar to become even more cost-competitive."<br><br>eSolar's modular and scalable CSP plant design utilizes sun tracking equipment that is easy to install, plus can be produced in high-quality factories and quickly assembled with simple tools and local customer workforces. These heliostats track the sun with high precision and reflect the sun's heat to a tower-mounted receiver, which boils water to create steam. This steam powers a traditional turbine and generator to produce clean electricity. Sanmina-SCI will bring their manufacturing and supply chain design input to the table via a joint engineering effort with eSolar designers.<br><br>"eSolar is making an important contribution in the global quest to produce renewable energy cost-competitively, and we are privileged to be selected to support this design effort," said Tom Clawson, executive vice president, industrial markets for Sanmina-SCI. "We're pleased our skills will be used to design some of the key building blocks for eSolar's utility-grade solar projects and play a role in increasing power generation from clean sources of energy."
