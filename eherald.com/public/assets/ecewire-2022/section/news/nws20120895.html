                    Gartner says the fastest-growing segment in the IT outsourcing market is cloud computing services, which is part of the cloud-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS) segment. Cloud computing services are expected to grow 48.7 percent in 2012 to $5.0 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2011, as per Gartner.<br><br>"Today, cloud compute services primarily provide automation of basic functions. As next-generation business applications come to market and existing applications are migrated to use automated operations and monitoring, increased value in terms of service consistency, agility and personnel reduction will be delivered", said Gregor Petri, research director at Gartner. "Continued privacy and compliance concerns may however negatively impact growth in some regions, especially if providers are slow in bringing localized solutions to market."
