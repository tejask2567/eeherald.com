In 1998, he moved back to India to run a design team that delivered over 25 SRAM products in technologies ranging from 0.5-micron to 90-nm. He returned to California in 2008 as a business unit director in the Memory Products Division. Now, with broad experience in process, design and product division management, Kothandaraman returns to India to oversee all of Cypress India's operations.<br><br>"Cypress's India story has been phenomenal," said Kothandaraman. "Unlike any other semiconductor company, we have end-to-end product development capabilities in India such as strategic marketing, design engineering, product and test engineering, software development, IT, applications engineering, business development, planning, operations and finance. We offer a great opportunity for talented engineers to build an experience-rich career in India. I am excited to be part of the India growth story."<br><br>"India has grown to be a vital part of Cypress in the last five years," said Rodgers. "It was important for us to have a successful Cypress veteran lead our India operations to its next level of growth, since many of our strategic new products such as PSoC, Memory and USB solutions are designed there. This is a big opportunity for Badri and for Cypress India to participate in leading Cypress to achieve our future goals. We are confident that our growth in India will be accelerated under his leadership."
