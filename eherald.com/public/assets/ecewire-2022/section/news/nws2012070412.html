                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    SEMI has released the Worldwide Photovoltaic Equipment Market Statistics Report for Q1 2012. The report shows the prolonged challenging environment for PV equipment suppliers. The worldwide photovoltaic manufacturing equipment billings dipped for the third successive quarter, falling another 20 percent for the quarter and 60 percent from the same quarter last year.<br><br>The total quarterly billings of $695 million reduced to the lowest level since the start of the data collection program in Q1 2010. The reported total bookings reversed a four-quarter declining trend, up 29 percent for the quarter to $591 million. However, the increase was due to a large one-time order in a Rest-of-World region. Excluding this one-time large order, total bookings sustained the negative growth in the last four quarters, down 36 percent for this quarter.<br><br><br>Semi pv<br><br><br><br><br>Source: SEMI Worldwide PV Equipment Market Statistics Report, June 2012<br><br>PV manufacturers continued overcapacity and balance sheet concerns. This resulted in capital expenditures being restricted and creating an extremely challenging environment for PV equipment suppliers worldwide. A major contraction in 2012 full-year revenue is expected in the PV equipment market.<br><br>The worldwide PV equipment billings and bookings data is gathered jointly with the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) from about 50 global equipment companies that provide primary data on a quarterly basis.<br><br>The SEMI’s report is available by subscription. Each subscription includes four quarterly reports and each quarterly report includes three parts:<br>1. Quarterly worldwide billings and bookings data report (Excel)<br>2. Highlights and analysis (PDF)<br>3. Billings and bookings database (with all historical data starting with 1Q’10, in Excel pivot table format).<br><br>Reporting categories:<br>1. Market region: Americas; Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Rest of Asia); Europe; Rest of World<br>2. Supply chain segment: Poly/Ingot/Wafer; Crystalline Silicon Cell; Crystalline Silicon Module; Thin Film<br>3. Equipment type: Component; Single Equipment; Equipment Lines<br><br>For more information: www.semi.org/en/node/38716<br><br>Source: semi.org
