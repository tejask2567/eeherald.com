                    Electronics manufacturing service provider Sanmina-SCI has announced that its India Design Center (IDC) located in the Madras Special Economic Zone (MEPZ) has been accredited with AS9100-Rev C for Avionics Systems and ISO 9001-2008 Certification.<br><br>"The aviation market is experiencing significant growth in India and most Tier I and Tier II companies are increasingly outsourcing to India to take advantage of incentives offered by the Indian government," said Srinivasa Moorthy, Vice President of Engineering and Head of the Sanmina-SCI India Design Center in Chennai. "The AS9100 certification enables us to provide our customers with the most advanced product customization services and total product lifecycle management. In addition, sustaining engineering services are available. These services have become important due to rapid obsolescence of some components and the issue of counterfeit components."<br><br>"Achieving the latest certifications demonstrates Sanmina-SCI's commitment to provide our defense and aerospace customers with the highest level of quality and technological expertise available," said Dr. Sundar Kamath, Senior Vice President of Technology at Sanmina-SCI. "Our unique success in India has been a direct result of our ability to meet our customers' needs in these critical areas, while enabling cost savings as a total manufacturing solution provider."
