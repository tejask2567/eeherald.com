                    GPU technology vendor Imagination estimates shipments of GPUs conformant with the Khronos OpenGL ES family of graphics APIs (Application Programming Interface) will reach 1 billion units per annum by 2014.<br><br>Imagination suggests that SoCs (systems on chip) capable of supporting OpenGL ES 3.0, including products incorporating PowerVR Series6 GPUs, will begin to ship in products in mid-2013, and that tablets, smartphones and other products supporting OpenGL ES 3.0 will become a significant and growing part of a billion unit market by 2014.<br><br>Tony King-Smith, VP marketing, Imagination says “The future of graphics is mobile. With such advanced features as multiple rendering targets, instancing, and more, Khronos’ OpenGL ES 3.0 is a significant step forward for mobile and embedded graphics, bringing mobile platforms another step closer to performance and feature set parity with traditionally more capable desktops and consoles. The widespread adoption by semiconductor manufacturers and developers has made our PowerVR family the GPU technology of choice for mobile application development. We are excited by this next phase of mobile GPU which will blur the boundaries between mobile and traditional high end graphics platforms.”
