                    <p>
                    Infineon Technologies has announced that the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) awarded the company a new contract to supply security chip technology embedded in the U.S. electronic passport.<br><br>GPO produces the electronic passport for the Department of State, which issues the document to U.S. citizens. The passports include a security chip embedded in the back cover. This chip securely stores the citizen’s credentials according to international standards of travel documents. In this new procurement, GPO named Infineon Technologies as a prime contractor.<br><br><br>The new five-year contract award extends Infineon’s engagement as a prime contractor to the largest electronic passport program in the world. Infineon has been a supplier to the program since GPO first began producing the documents in 2005. According to GPO, more than 80 million electronic passports have been produced to date.<br><br><br>Based on its core competencies in the fields of security, contactless communication and integrated microcontroller solutions (Embedded Control), Infineon offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor-based security products for many chip card and security applications. Infineon uses this expertise to increase security in an increasingly mobile and networked world, e.g. for mobile payments, system security and secure electronic governmental documents. Infineon has developed innovative, hardware-based security solutions for over 25 years and has been the world market leader for 14 years.<br><br>Source: Infineon
