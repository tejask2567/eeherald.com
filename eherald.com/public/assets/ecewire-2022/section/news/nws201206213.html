                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Agilent Technologies Inc. has announced that its ongoing collaboration with Thales has expanded the reach of X-parameters technology to wideband super-heterodyne receiver applications.<br><br>X-parameters characterize an entirely new category of nonlinear network parameters for high-frequency design. They allow engineers to accurately represent linear and nonlinear components, circuits or systems, and provide behavioral modeling-capabilities critical to designing high-performance RF modules and system-in-package components. X-parameters can be generated either from simulation with Agilent's Advanced Design System EDA software or from Agilent's test and measurement instruments.<br><br>The collaboration between Agilent and Thales on nonlinear behavioral models began in 2005. The primary aim of the effort was for Thales to validate the use of the technology for RF system design. Thales has successfully developed a spurious analysis methodology based on X-parameter models as part of this collaboration.<br><br>The Thales technique supports arbitrary topology and has been tested for RF systems with single-frequency conversion. Subsequent spurious analysis of such systems has yielded good results. The accuracy and dynamic range of the spectral content is said to be better than others.<br><br>"We are proud to have worked with Agilent over the years as the X-parameters concept has grown in acceptance within the industry," said Jean Paul Martinaud, hardware modeling manager with Thales Defence Mission Systems Division. "We have been able to extend the application of X-parameters to single-frequency conversion modeling, something that traditionally would have been done using conventional nonlinear behavioral models. We look forward to continuing this collaborative effort and working toward further extending the use of X-parameters to more complex systems."<br><br>"As the inventors of X-parameters, Agilent continues to innovate around the technology in response to the challenges of nonlinear modeling and measurement," said Thierry Locquette, a sales manager for Agilent EEsof EDA. "Our work with Thales has resulted in yet another proof-of-concept of this technology and further cements its position as the de facto industry standard."<br><br>For more information on X-parameters: www.agilent.com/find/eesof-x-parameters
