                    Market research firm Infonetics Research released excerpts from its fourth quarter 2011 (4Q11) Enterprise Routers vendor market share and forecast report.<br><br>"The demand for routers is there-overall volumes are essentially back to pre-recession levels-but buying patterns have changed and that in turn is hurting revenue, still down some 18% from the pre-recession peak," explains Matthias Machowinski, directing analyst for enterprise networks and video at Infonetics Research. "While the high-end of the market remains robust as buyers invest in congested and mission-critical parts of their network, there is significant substitution in the bulk of the market (branch and mid-range routing) with lower cost solutions."<br><br>ENTERPRISE ROUTER MARKET HIGHLIGHTS<br>Enterprise router sales rose 1% over 3Q11, to $920 million in 4Q11<br>From the year-ago quarter (4Q10), enterprise router sales are down 3%<br>For the full year, the enterprise router market is up a modest 2% from 2010 to 2011 to $3.5 billion<br>Growth in the enterprise router market in 2011 was driven almost entirely by China, which saw a 34% jump in revenue from the previous year<br>While Cisco's share of the enterprise router market dropped a couple of points in 2011, it still commands nearly 3/4 of the global market, and reversed a downward trend with a nice bump up in router revenue in the final quarter of 2011<br>HP more than doubled its enterprise router market share in 2011, thanks in large part to its exposure to the fast-growing Chinese market
