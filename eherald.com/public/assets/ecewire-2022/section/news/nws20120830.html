                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Taiwan based ITE Tech Inc. has executed a patent license agreement for use of certain IDT timing patents. IDT says ITE proactively approached IDT to license required IDT solid-state oscillator patents to strengthen the competitiveness of ITE’s integrated USB 2.0 flash drive controller.<br><br>“We are pleased to see ITE acknowledge the use of and contractually license our IP,” said Fred Zust, vice president and general manager of the Timing and Synchronization Division at IDT. “As demonstrated with the Phison patent litigation and settlement, IDT will actively seek and rectify patent infringements related to our solid-state oscillator IP. We encourage companies who feel that they may be infringing on our patents to step forward so that we may come to an agreement.”<br><br>“It became clear that some portions of IDT’s timing IP will be essential for USB controllers, and licensing the patents was the right thing to do for our customers and shareholders,” said Chanson Lin, general manager of BU1 (business unit 1) at ITE. “We approached IDT with our concerns and worked together to craft an agreement that ensured the continued success of both parties.”
