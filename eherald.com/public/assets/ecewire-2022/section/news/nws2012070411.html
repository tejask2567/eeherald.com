                    NPD DisplaySearch has conducted the Global TV Replacement Study. The report shows that in 14 regional markets surveyed, the use of tablets such as the iPad and Android-based devices by consumers for viewing TV/video content more than doubled.<br><br>Other findings by DisplaySearch:<br>This growth has occurred in combination with increased tablet adoption in these markets. The widespread tablet adoption was driven by improved connectivity infrastructure has facilitated use of these devices as alternate content-viewing devices.<br><br>The fastest growing region for tablet usage is Turkey, with tablet use growing from 3.1% in 2011 to 16.5% in 2012. In addition, there was strong tablet usage growth in Germany (up nearly fourfold Y/Y), France and the U.S. (both up more than threefold Y/Y).<br><br>Figure 1: Tablet usage for TV/Video content viewing by countries surveyed<br><br><br>tablet<br><br>Consumers, in addition to tablets, are also leveraging other alternate electronic devices such as laptops and mobile phones to view TV/video content. The study denotes that more than 70% of consumers use alternate electronic devices such as tablets, notebook PCs, smart phones, MP3 players and desktop computers to view TV/video content. In mature markets like the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, more number of people viewed video content on portable computing devices such as tablets and notebook PCs. In emerging markets like China, Indonesia, Russia and Turkey, consumers reported that they view content on mobile devices such as smart phones, likely due to the relatively high penetration of wireless networks.<br><br>“While the trends vary by region, it is evident that consumers around the globe are watching more video and TV content with their portable electronic devices as these provide additional means of accessing content,” noted Riddhi Patel, research director of Consumer Insights for NPD DisplaySearch. “Despite this increase, however, TVs still remain the primary device of choice for viewing TV content, with 30% of consumers reporting that they view TV/video content on TVs alone.”<br><br>Figure 2: Alternate ways consumers view TV/Video content<br><br><br>tablet<br><br>TV replacement cycles were shorter in 2012 than in 2011 despite increasing use of tablets and alternate smart devices in all the countries surveyed.

Increasing availability of these sets in a range of sizes and declining prices meet up with consumer needs and preferences globally.
