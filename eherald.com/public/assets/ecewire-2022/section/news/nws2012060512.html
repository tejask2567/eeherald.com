                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    CEVA, Inc. and ASTC's VWorks group have announced the availability of virtual platforms based on CEVA's CEVA-X and CEVA-XC DSP families. The virtual platforms reduce customers' embedded software development time and are already in use with a baseband vendor to aid the design of their LTE modems.<br><br>As part of the collaboration, CEVA DSP processor support models have been integrated with the VLAB SystemC virtual platform simulation environment, providing performance and direct DSP software debug capability. Software and services will be provided by VWorks.<br><br>"We are pleased to partner with CEVA to offer virtual platforms for their industry-leading CEVA-X and CEVA-XC families of DSPs, and accelerate the development of systems and software for mobile and other markets," said Jay Yantchev, CEO at ASTC / VWorks. "This successful collaboration has already resulted in our CEVA DSP-based virtual platforms being deployed with a leading baseband vendor for their LTE modem development."<br><br>"Virtual platforms are increasingly important in system design, verifying both hardware and software to decrease SoC design cycles," said Eran Briman, vice president of marketing at CEVA. "Virtual models of our CEVA DSPs integrated with VWorks VLAB enable complete system validation of hardware and software, parallelizing the development cycle."
