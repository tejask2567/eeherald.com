                    <p>
                    The ZigBee Alliance celebrates its first decade of successes this month, most particularly in enabling the growing machine-to- machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) trends and offering utilities and energy service providers with new consumer energy management and efficiency capabilities. Hundreds of manufacturers have shipped hundreds of millions of ZigBee products for a variety of energy management, commercial and consumer applications, helping consumers and businesses alike gain greater control of their worlds.<br><br>The ZigBee Alliance is now a thriving global ecosystem of 400+ companies developing standards and producing products for use in commercial building automation, consumer electronics, health care and fitness, home automation, energy management, retail management, wireless telecommunications. The Alliance was established in October 2002 to create global standards to connect the widest range of devices into secure, low-cost, low-power and easy-to-use wireless sensor and control networks. Today, nine innovative and interoperable standards let product manufacturers’ help their customers gain greater control of their everyday activities.<br><br>“ZigBee was purposefully designed to address capabilities not supported by other wireless technologies and continues to be the only standard capable of securely, economically and efficiently connecting thousands of electrical switches, lights, door locks, thermostats, cable set-top-boxes and a myriad of other devices, seamlessly into an Internet of Things,” said Bob Heile, chairman of the ZigBee Alliance. “The ZigBee Alliance remains focused on M2M and IoT market needs for wireless control and sensor networks. Our standards are the smartest choice for manufacturers and service providers in 11 vertical markets. Both market adoption and market forecasts show the ZigBee standards approach for control is proven and demand continues to increase.”<br><br>Market leadership:<br>The Alliance has reached the 600 ZigBee Certified product milestone this month. The Alliance developed the ZigBee Certified program to make certain that the ZigBee value chain is as reliable as a ZigBee network.<br><br>“The ZigBee Alliance took a visionary approach of identifying not only a technology need, but also application needs,” said Mareca Hatler, director of research with ON World. “Thanks to its leadership in the Smart Grid, smart homes and several other areas, many markets have products available today to meet industry demands and tools to create an efficient Internet of Things.”<br><br>Smart metering equipment is likely to lead market growth; the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia and other countries and U.S. states, like California, have set smart meter and home automation deployment targets for utilities. ZigBee Smart Energy is the first Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Home Area Network (HAN) standard and is playing an important role to help utilities meet these mandates. Global revenues for wireless and wired home energy management equipment and services to reach $4.3 billion in 2016, according to a recent ON World report, and ZigBee equipment is to capture almost half of that projected revenue.<br><br>In addition, the market for two-way communications between consumer electronics is also expected to rise. With annual ZigBee device shipments estimated to reach more than 350 million by 2016, according to ABI Research.<br><br>Innovative, application-specific standards:<br>While ZigBee Smart Energy and ZigBee Home Automation are the Alliance’s most celebrated and adopted application standards, as of today, the Alliance has developed a total of nine innovative application standards that offer advanced control and security capabilities along with expected product interoperability over the time proven ZigBee mesh network. Each standard addresses specific market needs of businesses and consumers, simplifying use by manufacturers and permitting for further product customization. Industry experts design each standard through a rigorous quality-focused process. All of the 600 ZigBee Certified products are based on ZigBee specifications and standards:<br><br>• ZigBee Building Automation<br>• ZigBee Health Care<br>• ZigBee Home Automation<br>• ZigBee Input Device<br>• ZigBee Light Link<br>• ZigBee Network Devices<br>• ZigBee Remote Control<br>• ZigBee Smart Energy<br>• ZigBee Telecom Services<br><br>Timeline:<br><br>2002 – ZigBee Alliance established with 25 members<br>2004 – ZigBee 2004 specification introduced, ends year with 124 members<br>2005 – Add Adopter membership level; ends year with 200 members<br>2006 – First ZigBee products begin to launch; ZigBee 2006 specification introduced<br>2007 – ZigBee 2007 specification introduced with popular ZigBee PRO feature set; ZigBee Home Automation completed; ends year with 250 members<br>2008 – ZigBee Smart Energy launched; First ZigBee Certified products enter market; ends year with 300 members<br>2009 – ZigBee RF4CE specification introduced; ZigBee Health Care and ZigBee Remote Control completed<br>2010 – ZigBee Telecom Services completed; 100 ZigBee Certified products; ends year with 400 members<br>2011 – 300 ZigBee Certified products; ZigBee Input Device, ZigBee Building Automation, ZigBee Gateway, completed.<br>2012 – ZigBee Light Link completed; ZigBee 2012 specification featuring ZigBee Green Power introduced; 600 ZigBee Certified products; 10th anniversary<br><br>For more information: visit: www.ZigBee.org<br><br>Source: ZigBee Alliance
