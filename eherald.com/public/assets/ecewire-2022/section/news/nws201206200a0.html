                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    EDA and IP company Dolphin Integration SA (Meylan, France) announced it has selected the LF 150 technology developed by LFoundry Rousset SAS to consolidate its presence on the European defense, industrial markets. Dolphin Integration and LFoundry said they have concluded a partnership for the fabrication of Dolphin’s products. These designs based on LFoundry LF 150 technology concern SOCs, ASICs and FPGA to ASIC migration. LFoundry said LF 150 is a modular 0.15µm RF CMOS process, offering up to 6 levels of Al plus thick metal (2 - 6µm), optionally a MIM capacitor, a polyimide passivation and I/O voltages of 1.8V, 3.3V and 5.0V.Dolphin said it has selected LFoundry’s LF 150 technology for the ability to ensure the continuous delivery of their semiconductor solutions, with their flexibility to support customer needs. LFoundry Rousset (Rousset, France) was formed in 2009 by the sale of a wafer fab in Rousset by Atmel Corp. to LFoundry GmbH which was based around a former Hitachi wafer fab in Landshut, Germany. The company was forced to close the Landshut fab and restructure in 2011.Since its formation in June 2009 LFoundry Rousset has been developing technologies targeted at added value applications such as smartcard, defense and aerospace, automotive and energy management. A development team at what became a subsidiary company, LFoundry Technologies GmbH located in Germany, has been working on developing process technologies, PDKs and providing engineering services.<br><br>Source: www.lfoundry.com
