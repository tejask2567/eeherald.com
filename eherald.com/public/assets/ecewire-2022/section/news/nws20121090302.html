                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Cypress Semiconductor Corp. has announced that Sysgration Ltd. has selected Cypress’s 2.4-GHz WirelessUSB-NL radio-on-a-chip for its “U” and “W” wireless presenter series. Sysgration is to also utilize Cypress’s enCoRe II microcontrollers in the presenter and complementary USB dongles.<br><br>WirelessUSB-NL features low active and standby current of less than 1 uA. The closed-loop radio architecture of the device minimizes signal frequency drift, thereby minimizing the need for re-transmissions. These enable presenters to run for 3 years on 2 AA batteries. The device also has -87 dBm receive sensitivity, forward error correction (FEC), and data whitening. As a result, the solution has interference immunity range of up to 30 meters.<br><br>“We are pleased to see Cypress’s WirelessUSB solution adopted by Sysgration in two of their widely accepted presenter series,” said Jayant Somani, Senior Director of Worldwide Marketing for Cypress’s Data Communication Division. “The endorsement from OEM/ODM customers shows the industry-leading battery life, long-range operation, and the superior noise immunity of Cypress’s WirelessUSB are widely accepted as the new benchmark for wireless PC peripherals’ performance.”<br><br>“Wireless presenters work in an environment full of RF interference, usually in offices with multiple wireless devices. Immunity to RF noise is a key factor for presenter performance. Users won’t accept any kind of malfunction caused by RF noise during an important presentation,” said Jim Wu, Marketing Director of Computer and Power Division of Sysgration. “Cypress’s high-performance solution with best-in-class interference immunity was the best solution for us. With Cypress’s excellent technical support, and superior reference designs with accompanying enCoRe microcontrollers, we created five models in two different series for our OEM customers with very short time to market. ”<br><br>Source: Cypress Semiconductor
