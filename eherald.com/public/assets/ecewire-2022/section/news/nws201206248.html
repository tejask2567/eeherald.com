                    <p>
                    Anritsu Company to demonstrate mm-Wave emission testing using its MS2830A Signal Analyzer and BridgeWave Communication's 80 GHz Wireless Ethernet Bridge at the IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS), to be held in Montreal from June 19-21.<br><br>The cellular industry is adopting E-band (60 to 90 GHz) gigabit data rate radios for 4G/LTE backhaul needs. Due to the generous amount of spectrum available, the multi-gigabit transmissions carriers are required to solve the backhaul bottleneck challenge. With 80 GHz solutions poised to be used for macrocell backhaul, and the adaptation of the 60 GHz spectrum for small cell backhaul, manufacturers, operators, and regulators need a way to validate transmitter performance at mm-wave frequencies.<br><br>U.S. FCC and Industry Canada require all mm-wave transmitters be measured and verified using a spectrum analyzer with external mixer capability. The FCC works with the Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) to define test procedures. The TCB is an accredited organization with the authority to issue Grants of Certification for compliance with Federal Communications Commission Rules & Regulations.<br><br>The MS2830A has an external mixer design to achieve good dynamic range. The device utilizes an intermediate frequency (IF) of 1.875 GHz (IF Output with 1 GHz bandwidth) and LO ranges of 5 GHz to 10 GHz. This makes the device reduce the multiplier magnitude necessary for mm-wave coverage. The sensitivity is increased by the lower multipliers which improve the conversion loss of the external mixer, allowing the Signal Analyzer to measure low-level mm-wave signals. Using this configuration, the MS2830A can measure E-band (60-90 GHz, WR-12) with better DANL (nominal -120 dBm/Hz @ 80 GHz) based on typical external mixer conversion loss of 36 dB, which represents a minimum 4-8 dB improvement over existing solutions.<br><br>The MS2830A with E-band external mixer (option 044) solution is priced at US $50,000.
