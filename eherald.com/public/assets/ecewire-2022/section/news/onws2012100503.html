                    Silicon Image has announced that its 60GHz wireless, home theater, and mobile technologies have been included in Sharp’s new VR-WH1 wireless adapter. The adapter is designed to connect up to four source devices including MHL-enabled smartphones to HD displays using WirelessHD technology.<br><br>Silicon Image is to showcase the Sharp VR-WH1 wireless adapter in the Silicon Image demo suite at the APA Resort Hotel (Makuhari Messe) in Chiba, Japan during the 2012 CEATEC show from October 2-5, 2012.<br><br>“Being able to support a wide range of device connection options with the highest quality audio and video was key in the development of the VR-WH1 wireless adapter, and Silicon Image’s technologies met all of our requirements,” said Ryoji Ohno, division general manager of Sharp’s Audio-Visual Systems Group. “We are focused on offering users a product with tremendous flexibility and performance for a superior entertainment experience and the VR-WH1 wireless adapter delivers on this promise.”<br><br>The Sharp VR-WH1 is a WirelessHD-enabled adapter pair offering a 4-port input transmitter that supports connections to both MHL and HDMI source devices, and a WirelessHD receiver that connects to any HDMI-compliant display. The VR-WH1 integrates Silicon Image’s SiI6310/6320/6321 Gen3 chipset and SiI9573 port processor to provide a feature-packed solution that includes:<br>1. 60GHz WirelessHD-compliant connectivity for uncompressed, full HD-quality wireless video transmission with near-zero latency<br>2. MHL input for connectivity with the latest generation of smartphones and portable devices<br>3. HDMI 1.4b support for 1080P/60 and 3D video, as well multiple audio formats, including Dolby Digital, DTS, and High Bitrate formats such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS MasterHD<br>4. InstaPortS technology for fast switching between HDMI inputs<br>5. InstaPrevue technology, which provides a live picture-in-picture preview of every HDMI/MHL input<br><br>“The Sharp VR-WH1 adapter showcases the breadth of technologies Silicon Image offers for high-definition connectivity,” said Tim Vehling, vice president and general manager of the wireless division at Silicon Image, Inc. “Based on our Gen3 WirelessHD chipset, the Sharp adapter is ideal for consumers who want a compelling experience for wirelessly connecting multiple high-definition AV products – including MHL-enabled smartphones and portable devices – to HD displays where cable connections are impractical.”<br><br>For more information: http://www.siliconimage.com/<br><br>Source: Silicon Images
