                    ABI Research forecasts global driver assistance systems revenues to grow from $22.7 Billion in 2012 to $460.8 Billion in 2017. Asia-Pacific to lead in ADAS market throughout the forecast period, as per ABI.<br><br>Dominique Bonte, Vice President and practice director, ABI Research comments: "Both commercial and regulatory drivers are expected to boost the ADAS market in the coming years. On one hand OEMs such as Ford have started rolling out ADAS features on medium to low-end cars in order to bolster their safety image. On the other hand, ADAS will ultimately be mandated in many regions as illustrated by recent statements of the European Commission and Euro NCAP (New Car Assessment Program) about making autonomous-emergency braking (AEB) technology part of European crash evaluations from 2014, an important step towards making AEB mandatory."<br><br>ABI finds in the longer-term ADAS to play an important supporting role in intelligent transportation systems and (semi-) autonomous vehicles as recently demonstrated in the SARTRE drive train trial in Europe in which the main role of ADAS systems is to be the last safety resort when other systems fail.<br><br>ABI suggests automotive OEMs to offer (basic) ADAS as a standard feature.
