                    From long time Intel had made available another stream of exclusive processors for high performance industrial embedded computer which includes single board computers used in signage and Kiosk applications. Intel has pushed even harder into this market in last 3/4 years. Intel has a huge share in this market. AMD is hardly present in this market. AMD started focusing on embedded computer market only in 2012, which cost heavily on its growth.<br><br>AMD has announced that revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012 is expected to decrease approximately 11 percent sequentially. AMD quotes lower preliminary revenue results are primarily due to business conditions that materialized late in the second quarter, specifically softer-than-expected channel sales in China and Europe as well as a weaker consumer buying environment impacting the company's Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) business. This is may be for the PC and server market. Intel's PC and server chip business too is affected by the weak economy, but Intel's subtle focus on industrial computer boards and the mobile segments differentiates from AMD. AMD is doing same mistake in the mobile device market.<br><br>If we look at another processor tech expert ARM, its processor cores had played little role in high performance industrial computers. Now with ARM Cortex A15, it has entered the market. Already there are boards designed by vendors like Kontron using ARM Cortex powered processors.
