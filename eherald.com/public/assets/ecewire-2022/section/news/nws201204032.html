                    In year 2011 the total revenue of semiconductor foundries business, which is more called as semiconductor fab services is estimated as 29.8 Billion US$ by Gartner, a 0.7% growth in revenue compared to 2010. Semiconductor fab services revenues is approximately 10% of total semiconductor device revenue. The reasons for less growth given by Gartner includes 'Japanese disaster' and 'Thailand flooding'. Even though the chip market was hit by naturals disasters the demand for mobile phones and tablet computers have helped to keep the growth.<br><br>There were media reports early this year about yield issues in 28nm. That is not looks to be true as per the experts. The 28nm is becoming the diffrentiator for fabs such as TSMC and Globalfoundries. TSMC has expanded its revenue over 2010 to have 48.8 % share in 2011, as per Gartner.<br><br>According to Gartner's latest study the top five foundries accounted for 80% foundry market share.

Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) who are using fablite model contributed 20.2 percent, and the remaining came from system companies, as per Gartner.
