                    <p>
                    BMW Group, Qualcomm , and Arriver jointly developing next gen Automated Driving Systems.The effort uses BMW's current AD stack with Arriver's Vision Perception and NCAP Drive Policy products on Qualcomm Technologies' SOC semiconductor chips, in designing cutting-edge Automated Driving functions spanning NCAP, Level 2 and Level 3.<br><br>The codevelopment to focus on joint development of next-generation AD technologies ranging from New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), Level 2 Advanced Driving Assistance Systems to Level 3 High Automated Driving functionalities. BMW Automated Driving software stack based BMW's next generation Automated Driving System to be ported on the Snapdragon Ride Vision system-on-chip (SoC) including Arriver Computer Vision and the Snapdragon Ride Platform's compute SoC controllers managed by Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud Services platform.<br><br>The research team from three companies to create a scalable platform for automated driving based on a common reference architecture, sensor-set specifications, and safety requirements with joint development, toolchain, and a data center for storage, reprocessing, and simulation. The cooperation will see more than 1,400 specialists working together in locations worldwide, including Germany, USA, Sweden, China, Romania, and the BMW AD Test Center in Czech Republic.<br><br>"This joint software development is an important milestone for the BMW Group with regards to our next generation Automated Driving platform. To enable sophisticated and safe functionalities in a vehicle you need state-of-the art software in all components of the digital value chain. This forms the backbone for intelligent driver assistance systems. The BMW Group is excited to further extend our partnership with global technology leaders Qualcomm Technologies and Arriver to include a long-lasting strategic co-development cooperation in order to continue delivering world-class driving experiences to our customers." says Nicolai Martin, Senior Vice President Driving Experience, BMW Group.<br><br>"We are proud of this long-term cooperation with the BMW Group and Arriver which focuses on co-development and deployment of Automated Driving systems from NCAP to Level 3 customer functionality in BMW upcoming series production vehicles," said Nakul Duggal, Senior Vice President and General Manager Automotive, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. "Building on already commercialized stack components from BMW Group and Arriver, this cooperation will position us to extend BMW Automated Drive software to the Snapdragon Ride platform, and expand the accessibility of safer self-driving technologies to other automakers and Tier-1s in an open, flexible and scalable deployment framework.  We believe Snapdragon Ride will create significant economies of scale and time-to-market benefits across the automotive industry with the launch of the automated driving software globally in BMW's series production vehicles, which have always been an exemplar of the highest quality, performance and safety standards in modern day automobiles."  <br><br>"We are pleased that Arriver's Vision Perception and market proven NCAP features will be combined with the BMW Automated Driving software stack. Joining forces with Qualcomm Technologies and BMW Group Arriver's team will co-develop the next generation of open and scalable Drive Policy with world-class feature solutions and performance. This co-developed product will be offered to our customers globally. This cooperation is a key milestone for Arriver and a proof point of the rich competence of our teams through years of experience in ADAS & safety," said Giuseppe Rosso, President and Managing Director, Arriver. <br><br>Arriver’s vision perception software will be running on the Snapdragon Ride Platform, a product of Qualcomm Technologies. The start of production is slated for 2025. The collaboration contemplates, but is not limited to, the deployment of deep learning algorithms for vision perception with a full suite of vision functions.
