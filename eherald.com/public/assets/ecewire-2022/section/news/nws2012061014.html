                    <p>
                    Sierra Wireless has announced that Audi is using Sierra Wireless AirPrime embedded wireless modules to help develop and test an LTE-connected infotainment system. The system is still in the development stage and has been showcased at several industry events this year. Drive tests were started in late 2011.<br><br>Sierra Wireless AirPrime modules are available with varying combinations of LTE frequency bands and fallback technologies. The company claims that these were the first LTE modules available that allowed Audi to work on the leading edge of wireless technology as LTE networks roll out.<br><br>"We recognize that automotive customers, with longer product development cycles and products that stay in operation for several years, face special challenges in integrating rapidly evolving wireless technologies," said Didier Dutronc, senior vice president, Embedded M2M solutions for Sierra Wireless. "We are uniquely positioned to help these customers, with depth of expertise and experience in both automotive M2M requirements and in developing and deploying products for leading edge wireless technologies like LTE. Audi has a long history of technology innovation and we are proud to play a role in developing the connected car of the future."
