                    Market research firm Infonetics Research has reported it expects the overall optical transceiver market to post about a 7% increase over last year, and to grow in healthy double digits to reach close to $2.0 billion in 2013.<br><br>“100G continues to surpass even our most optimistic projections,” reports Andrew Schmitt, principal analyst for optical at Infonetics Research. “There’s been a flurry of prototyping, sampling and trial activity all around the world, including China, where plans for 100G have been bumped up by 12 months since we spoke to operators there last spring. In line with our aggressive forecasts, worldwide shipments of 100G coherent transceivers more than tripled in 2012, and will at least double in 2013.”<br><br>Schmitt adds, “The other big deal in the transceiver market is that the pricing gap collapsed between tunable and non-tunable XFP, further spurring adoption of tunable XFP technology.”<br><br>Other highlights by Infonetics:<br>Unit shipments of 10G, 40G and 100G transceivers continue to increase, but revenue for 10G and 40G is under pressure from price declines and the shift to 100G.<br>Shipments of 100G coherent transceivers more than tripled in 2012, and will at least double in 2013<br>By 2015, 40G and 100G transceiver revenue together will match 10G transceiver revenue for the first time<br>Infonetics anticipates network equipment manufacturers (NEMs) to supply more than 3/4 of all 100G long reach ports by 2014–2015
