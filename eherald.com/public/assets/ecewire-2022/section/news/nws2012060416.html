                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) has announced the demonstrations of the new ZigBee Light Link standard on the CC2530 ZigBee system-on-chip (SoC). ZigBee Light Link standardizes wireless networked LED lighting systems making them easier to install, manage and operate than previous closed proprietary systems. TI's CC2530 is a certified Golden Unit for ZigBee Light Link enabling developers and manufacturers to quickly build and test ZigBee Light Link products for interoperability.<br><br>1. TI's ZigBee Light Link demonstrations during Computex Taipei this week, June 5 - 8, in booth TICC 101D, would showcase a complete LED light management system using a smartphone, low cost gateway and LED devices. Direct lighting controls will be shown using an Android smartphone outfitted with a microSD card that integrates the CC2530 SoC to control lighting directly.<br>2. The second demonstration uses an Android smartphone connected to a low-cost gateway (a CC2531 ZigBee USB dongle attached to a BeagleBone, the Sitara AM335x ARM Cortex-A8 processor-based open-source community board) to control and monitor ZigBee lighting and other devices.<br><br>"ZigBee Light Link is expected to transform the lighting industry, making it easy for non-professionals to network and control their LED lighting from smartphones, tablets, gateways and more," said Mark Grazier, program manager of wireless sensor networks and worldwide third party developer network, TI, and ZigBee Alliance board member. "As a certified Golden Unit, TI's CC2530 quickly enables manufacturers to productize their ZigBee Light Link devices. Additionally, with a CC2530-enabled microSD card, after-market devices can connect to ZigBee lighting delivering another path for manufacturers and consumers to embrace ZigBee-enabled LED lighting."<br><br>The CC2530 is a System-on-Chip solution for IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee and RF4CE applications. With an integrated RF transceiver, microcontroller, in-system programmable Flash and RAM, the CC2530 enables robust wireless network nodes.<br><br>The CC2530 ZigBee SoC is available now and is packaged in a ROHS-compliant 6 x 6 mm QFN-40 package.
