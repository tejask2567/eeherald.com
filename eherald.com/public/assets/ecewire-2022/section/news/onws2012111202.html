                    <p>
                    Fujitsu Semiconductor has achieved high output power of 2.5kW in server power-supply units equipped with gallium-nitride (GaN) power devices built on a silicon substrate. Fujitsu is exhibiting these devices at Embedded Technology 2012 Conference and Exhibition (Nov. 14-16 at the Pacifico Yokohama Convention Center in Japan), and to start volume production of the GaN power devices by the second half of 2013.<br><br>Fujitsu Semiconductor plans to commercialize GaN power devices on a silicon substrate, increasing the diameters of the silicon wafers and enabling low-cost production. The company began work on GaN technology in 2009 and has provided specific power-supply-related partners with sample GaN power devices since 2011. Since then, Fujitsu has worked on optimizing them for use in power supply units.<br><br>Fujitsu developed device technologies, such as optimizing the design of electrodes to control the rise of on-resistance during switching, and devising a circuit layout for power supply units that can support high-speed switching of GaN-based devices.<br><br>Fujitsu Semiconductor created a prototype server power-supply unit incorporating a power-factor-correction circuit based on GaN technology that achieved output power of 2.5kW.<br><br>Fujitsu Semiconductor has established a mass-production line for 6-inch wafers at its Aizu-Wakamatsu plant, and will begin full-scale production of GaN power devices in the second half of 2013.
