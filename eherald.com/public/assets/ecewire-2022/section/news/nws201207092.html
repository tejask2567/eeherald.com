                    <p>
                    Gigaphoton said it will soon start shipping new hardware and software products for enhancing lithography exposure performance of its laser light source equipment GT6xA ArF excimer laser series for multi-pattern immersion lithography scanners used in semiconductor chip making. Gigaphoton to begin shipping its “s” series hardware and software products in the 3rd quarter of 2012.<br><br>Gigaphoton explains: The “s” series functions include four types of technologies: sMPL creating greater depth of focus with precise spectrum control using a newly developed line-narrowing module (LNM) and dedicated software; sGRYCOS lowering operating costs with a newly developed chamber; sTGM reaching higher uptime with a combination of a newly developed absolute wavelength calibration module (AWM) and control software; and sMONITORING ensuring high performance stability with sophisticated monitoring software. In the semiconductor industry where fierce price competition is common, it is essential to enhance equipment performance and reduce operating costs and downtime. Gigaphoton’s “s” series functions perfectly meet these requirements.<br><br>The “s” series functions are included on the GT63A model as standard features*1 and are available as upgrades for the GT60A*2, GT61A, and GT62A.<br><br>“It is very important that the excimer laser used for lithography scanners enhance exposure performance and throughput as well as ensure reliability. But, satisfying these requirements at lower cost is equally important. We will start shipping the “s” series functions to match these needs. I believe this will create additional value for our customers. We at Gigaphoton will continue to respond to our customers’ trust with leading-edge technologies and support teams,” said Hitoshi Tomaru, president of Gigaphoton.
