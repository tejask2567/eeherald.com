                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    The ZigBee Alliance has completed development and ratified the ZigBee Light Link standard. The lighting industry now has an open, global standard, backed by a broad competitive ecosystem, offering wireless control for efficient and flexible LED lighting solutions.<br><br>The Alliance has created a standard that will be as easy to use as a common dimmer switch. Energy efficient light bulbs, LED fixtures, sensors, timers, remotes and switches built using ZigBee Light Link will easily connect into a single network, without special devices to coordinate the network.<br><br>Consumers will be able to easily install products and add extra devices to their lighting network. ZigBee Light Link devices can be controlled over the Internet through computers, tablets and smart phones. Consumers will enjoy the benefits of wireless lighting control and the ability to combine products from multiple brands. The ZigBee Light Link standard is now available for ZigBee Alliance members for product development.<br><br>Development and validation of this standard was led by lighting experts including GE, Greenwave Reality, OSRAM Sylvania and Philips. TRaC Global provided independent testing services for the first ZigBee certified products submitted by Atmel, Ember, OSRAM, Philips and Texas Instruments.<br><br>"Standards development within the ZigBee Alliance is driven by our enthusiastic membership and they're to be congratulated for their work on ZigBee Light Link," said Bob Heile, chairman of the ZigBee Alliance. "ZigBee Light Link sets a new bar. It provides a very affordable, easy to install and easy to use standalone lighting solution specifically addressing the general consumer market, but at the same time remains capable of integrating with the broader family of ZigBee home automation solutions."<br><br>More information on ZigBee Light Link is at www.ZigBee.org/LightLink
