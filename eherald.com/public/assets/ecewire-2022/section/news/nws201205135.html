                    <p>
                    The Wi-Fi Alliance has announced that it will begin to certify products for two new programs that deliver enterprise grade voice quality, mobility, power savings and security protections.<br><br>Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Voice-Enterprise is designed to support good voice call quality in large enterprise networks that require support for advanced WPA2-Enterprise security mechanisms. The program builds on the existing Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Voice-Personal program to support fast transitions between access points APs and provide management for voice applications.<br><br>Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WMM-Admission Control provides bandwidth management tools to optimize the delivery of voice and video traffic in Wi-Fi networks.<br><br>The new certification programs will provide enterprise IT managers solutions for better voice quality and bandwidth management in their Wi-Fi networks. The benefits such as priority for voice applications, seamless mobility, power savings and advanced security protection are provided by these certified programs.<br><br>"These new certification programs reflect Wi-Fi's continued prominence as an enterprise networking technology and bring important new tools to meet the needs of demanding enterprise applications," said Kelly Davis-Felner, marketing director of the Wi-Fi Alliance. "As enterprise connectivity continues to evolve, Wi-Fi Alliance will continue to give IT managers confidence that products will meet the needs of ever-more-complex networks."<br><br>Voice-Enterprise and WMM-Admission Control-certified devices can connect with older Wi-Fi CERTIFIED devices, enabling devices already in use to connect with products implementing these new features. Voice-Enterprise and WMM-Admission Control-certified devices can support Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n technology, as well as other versions of Wi-Fi.<br><br>Products selected as the test suite devices for Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Voice-Enterprise testing are:<br>1. Aruba 105 wireless access point and Aruba 3200 controller<br>2. Broadcom wireless-N WLAN mini-card adapter reference design<br>3. Cisco Aironet 1260 series access point and Cisco Aironet 2100 series WLAN controller<br>4. DSP Group Expeditor TB Wi-Fi reference board<br>5. Marvell plug computer with 8787 dual band Wi-Fi<br>6. Meru 802.11abgn AP310 access point and Meru MC1500 controller<br>7. Qualcomm Atheros XSPAN reference design concurrent dual-band access point<br>8. Research In Motion BlackBerry Bold 9000<br><br>Products selected as test suite devices for the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WMM-Admission Control testing are:<br>1.
