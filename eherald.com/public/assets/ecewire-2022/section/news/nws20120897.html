                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Kilopass Technology has announced it has expanded enablement of its XPM (eXtra Permanent Memory) NVM IP on the Dongbu HiTek AN180 and BD180 BCD (Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS) processes. Kilopass' JEDEC-qualified embedded NVM IP is used to store analog trim, product configuration data, and code storage in BCD process technology.<br><br>“As the market for smart power in portable devices as well as automobiles, homes, and computer equipment continues to develop so too does the demand for embedded NVM in BCD process technology,” said Linh Hong, vice president of sales and marketing at Kilopass Technology Inc. “Traditionally, a few bits to a few kilobits are needed for storing trim and calibration in power management designs. However, we are seeing a trend where power management designs are becoming embedded systems where code storage integration is required. Kilopass has solutions to meet a wide variety of usages from 16b to 256kb in BCD.”<br><br>“We are seeing increased customer demand for one-time programmable NVM in our 180nm BCD processes for power management in home consumer, mobile, and hard disk drive applications,” said Byung Joo Park, vice president of Marketing at Dongbu. “Offering up to six layers of aluminum interconnects and supporting 1.8V/3.3V operation, our 180nm BCD processes employ shallow trench isolation structures to optimize chip density and transistor characteristics. We are pleased that our NVM IP partner Kilopass has qualified their XPM NVM IP on our AN180 and BD180BCD processes. Our customers now have a field programmable NVM memory solution for trimming analog and mixed signal components that can drift over time and to store program code that may need to be altered occasionally during the life of a device.”
