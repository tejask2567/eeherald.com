                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Memory semiconductor vendor Micron and processor and SoC chip vendor Intel have decided to work independently on future generations of 3D NAND after jointly developing and producing 3-D NAND flash memories for longtime. They intent to develop 3-D NAND flash independently addressing their individual business needs.<br><br>However they have agreed to complete development of their third generation of 3D NAND technology and planned to deliver by the end of this year and extending into early 2019. <br><br>Micron and Intel still continue to jointly develop and manufacture 3D Xpoint at the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) joint venture fab in Lehi, Utah, which is now entirely focused on 3D XPoint memory production. <br><br>"Micron's partnership with Intel has been a long-standing collaboration, and we look forward to continuing to work with Intel on other projects as we each forge our own paths in future NAND development," said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of Technology Development, Micron. "Our roadmap for 3D NAND technology development is strong, and we intend to bring highly competitive products to market based on our industry-leading 3D NAND technology."<br><br>"Intel and Micron have had a long-term successful partnership that has benefited both companies, and we've reached a point in the NAND development partnership where it is the right time for the companies to pursue the markets we're focused on," said Rob Crooke, senior vice president and general manager of Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, Intel Corporation. "Our roadmap of 3D NAND and Optane™ technology provides our customers with powerful solutions for many of today's computing and storage needs."<br><br>DRAMeXchange  said it does not exclude the possibilities of their re-cooperation in NAND Flash development in the future. After parting ways, the two companies may also seek cooperation opportunities with other manufacturers, for instance Chinese makers, in order to increase their market competitiveness.<br><br>There is also news of Intel licensing its 3-D NAND tech to China-based Yangtze River Memory , subsidiary of Tsinghua Unigroup.  There was also news stories of Yangtze River getting technology license for advancing the 3-D NAND from Hynix, which Yangtze River has denied.
