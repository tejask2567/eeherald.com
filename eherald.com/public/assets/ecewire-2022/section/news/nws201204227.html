                    Basd on the study by IHS iSuppli into MEMS products for consumer and mobile applications STMicroelectronics has shared below finding from IHS study:<br><br>ST is said to hold 50% of the market in accelerometers.<br>ST achieved digital MEMS microphone sales of more than 15 million units to overtake competitors in major cellphone and laptop PC accounts.<br>ST achieved digital MEMS microphone sales of more than 15 million units to overtake competitors in major cellphone and laptop PC accounts.<br>ST more than doubled its sales of gyroscopes in 2011, to more than $350 million, taking a strong position in a market that the research firm predicts will grow to over $900 million by 2015. This sales growth includes 3-axis gyroscopes, which ST is able to apply in automotive systems such as navigation and telematics.<br>ST has begun shipments of MEMS pressure sensors and has the potential to develop products for automotive Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS); a market it says will show Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of close to 39% from 2010 to 2015.<br>STMicroelectronics' MEMS revenues have grown more than 80% through 2011.<br><br>"We have pioneered the use of plastic package technology, as well as techniques to avoid mechanical stresses on the MEMS mechanisms, which ensure optimum performance and reliability," explained Fabio Pasolini, General Manager, Motion MEMS Division, Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group of STMicroelectronics Industrial and Multisegment Sector.
