                    <p>
                    According to the SEMI's April Book-to-Bill report, North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment posted $1.60 billion in orders in April 2012 (three-month average basis) and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10. A book-to-bill of 1.10 means that $110 worth of orders were received for every $100 of product billed for the month.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide bookings in April 2012 was $1.60 billion. The bookings figure is 10.7 percent higher than the final March 2012 level of $1.45 billion, and is essentially flat compared to orders posted in April 2011.<br><br>The three-month average of worldwide billings in April 2012 was $1.45 billion. The billings figure is 13.0 percent more than the final March 2012 level of $1.29 billion, and is 11.0 percent less than the April 2011 billings level of $1.64 billion.<br><br>"Equipment orders in April increased to the value last reported one year ago," said Dan Tracy, senior director of Industry Research & Statistics at SEMI. "Since the last book-to-bill report, indications of increased spending have come from both the foundry and packaging subcontractor segments."<br><br>The SEMI book-to-bill is a ratio of three-month moving averages of worldwide bookings and billings for North American-based semiconductor equipment manufacturers.<br><br>Month	Billings (3-month avg)	Bookings (3-month.avg)	Book-to-Bill<br>Nov-11	1,176.70	977.2	0.83<br>Dec-11	1,300.00	1,102.90	0.85<br>Jan-12	1,239.90	1,187.50	0.96<br>Feb-12	1,322.80	1,336.90	1.01<br>March 2012 (final)	1,287.60	1,445.70	1.12<br>April 2012 (prelim)	1,454.70	1,600.70	1.1<br>Billings and bookings figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.<br><br>Source: SEMI May 2012
