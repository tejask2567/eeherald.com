                    <p>
                    Advantech has announced a family of video processing products based on Texas Instruments' TMS320C6678 multicore DSP. Advantech's commercial off-the-shelf platform supports JPEG 2000 codec optimized for TI's TMS320C6678 DSP.<br><br>"Advantech is accelerating the evolution of video platforms for OEMs through innovative DSP solutions which enable faster capture, encoding and processing at higher resolutions and data rates than ever before." said David Lin, director DSP solutions, Advantech. "We'll be demonstrating how our latest products, based on TI's DM8168 DaVinci digital media processors and C6678 multicore DSPs, are setting new standards in video processing innovation and performance," he added.<br><br>Advantech's DSPC-8681 video engine, a quad C6678 half-length PCIe, is capable of transcoding multiple channels of video. This provides sufficient computing power to perform video encoding/decoding at resolutions up to 4k x 2k using the JPEG2000 codec. This is encoding or decoding in real-time and spanning four TI C6678 devices simultaneously.<br><br>"This new platform from Advantech offers our high performance video processors in robust industry-standard form factors, facilitating more rapid product development by our customers," said Sean Gardner, video infrastructure business manager, Texas Instruments. "By running the JPEG 2000 codec on Advantech's DSPC-8681 we have been able to reduce the cost by 50%. This has the potential to enable new video applications at 4k x 2k resolution that previously would not have been feasible."<br><br>Advantech has also introduced the DSPC-8682 video processing engine, a full length PCIe card with eight TI C6678 DSPs. The platform supports 2K/4K resolution with JPEG2000 or other standard codecs and will provide the opportunity for future video processing needs such as handling of 8k video or adoption of future codec standards such as HEVC (H.265).<br><br>High-speed inter-DSP communications on both cards provides low latency interconnects for scalable real-time multi-processing and connections to the host through a high-bandwidth PCIe x8 gen 2 interface. The DSPC-8681 and DSPC-8682 are able to perform 1,024 and 2,048 GMAC (Giga Multiply-Accumulation operations per second) respectively using the embedded C66x DSP cores inside the C6678 device.<br><br>TI's multicore software development kit (MCSDK) will run on the DSPC-8681, DSPC-8682 and future Advantech platforms allowing OEMs to deploy scalable product lines with quad or octal DSP boards. These platforms enable compact, low slot-count systems such as 1RU rack-mountable transcoding platforms or scale up to meet higher density needs requiring 20-slot integrated systems with multiple board payloads.<br><br>Advantech has also released its new 8-channel video acquisition board, the DSPC-8662, based on four TI TMS320DM8168 media processors. The full length PCIe board supports SDI-SD/HD/3G and ASI inputs with an optional 4-channel HDMI video output for the delivery of multiple 1080p60 full high-definition (FHD) video streams with 4:2:0 pixel samples.<br><br>The DSPC-8662 may be used in video functions such as acquisition, encoding, decoding, transcoding, video walls, multi-viewers and surveillance. Gigabit ethernet provides network access while PCIe connectivity speeds integration into existing video carrier platforms. DSPC-8662 is now available with Linux and Windows based sample software code.<br><br>Advantech will be exhibiting these above products at the NABSHOW, Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada USA on April 16 - 19, 2012 in booth #SU11006.<br><br> <br>          	<br>Xilinx 7 series FPGA<br>Home | News | New Products | India Specific | Design Guide | Sourcing database | Student Section | About us | Contact us | What's New
