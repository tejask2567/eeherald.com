                    Market research firm Infonetics Research released excerpts its latest DDoS Prevention Appliances vendor market share and forecast report, which tracks distributed denial of service (DDoS) appliances deployed to protect enterprise and carrier data centers, mobile networks, wired carrier transport and broadband networks, and government transport networks.<br><br>“While the market for dedicated DDoS prevention solutions remains strong, going forward the overall performance of the market and the vendors in it will be challenged by the widening availability of hosted/SaaS solutions and new integrated security platforms that include DDoS prevention as a feature,” notes Jeff Wilson, principal analyst for security at Infonetics Research. “Arbor Networks and Alcatel-Lucent recently announced a combined offering that couples Alcatel-Lucent routers and a specialized DDoS mitigation blade from Arbor. And F5 recently launched a specialized data center firewall product based on its BigIP traffic management platform, with DDoS prevention as a cornerstone feature.”<br><br><br>Wilson adds: “We expect other major security vendors to build specialized security platforms with integrated DDoS prevention that will go head-to-head with mid-range offerings from the dedicated DDoS appliance vendors.”<br><br>Market highlights shared by Infonetics:<br>Sustained DDoS activity will drive the prevention market to 24% growth in 2012 over 2011<br>The data center segment of the DDoS prevention market is growing fast and is expected to pass the carrier transport segment by the end of 2012<br>Arbor Networks, the largest vendor in the DDoS prevention appliance market, maintains a commanding overall lead with nearly 3/5 of global revenue, although Radware is challenging in the government network segment<br>Combined, all segments of the DDoS prevention market—data center, carrier transport, mobile, and government—are forecast by Infonetics to top $420 million by 2016<br>Mobile networks will see the strongest growth in the DDoS prevention market, with a 30% CAGR over the 5 years between 2011 and 2016
