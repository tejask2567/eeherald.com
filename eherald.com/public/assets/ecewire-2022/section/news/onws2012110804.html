                    <p>
                    Imec and Nantero have announced a joint development program focusing on the carbon-nanotube-based memory developed by Nantero, NRAM, and its application in high-density next-generation memories with a size under 20nm. Imec to manufacture NRAM arrays at its nanoelectronics facilities.<br><br>“After review of the progress to date by Nantero and its manufacturing partners, we decided that this CNT-based non-volatile memory has multiple very attractive characteristics for next-generation highly scaled memory,” said Luc Van den hove, CEO of imec. “By taking a leadership position in this area of development, in partnership with Nantero, we will be able to bring substantial benefit to our member companies.”<br><br>Nantero has already fabricated high-yielding 4Mb arrays of NRAM in CMOS production environments, with several important performance advantages: write speed has been shown to be as fast as 3 nanoseconds; endurance is expected to be unlimited and has been tested so far to over a trillion cycles, with low operating power and superior high temperature retention.<br><br>“Together, Nantero and imec can develop and demonstrate this form of memory for future applications below 20nm such as terabit-scale memory arrays and ultra-fast gigabit-scale nonvolatile cache memories,” commented Jo de Boeck, CTO of imec, “NRAM holds clear promise in aggressively scaled Non-Volatile Memory applications and, if we can demonstrate the suitable endurance and speed specifications, NRAM could even provide an alternative for DRAM that is facing scaling limitations beyond 18nm.”<br><br>“Nantero is pleased to work with imec as a partner,” said Greg Schmergel, Nantero’s co-founder and CEO. “Nantero is already working with world-leading manufacturers, and working with imec will enable these efforts to bring carbon nanotube memory to market to move even faster.”
