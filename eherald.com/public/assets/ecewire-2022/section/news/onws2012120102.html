                    <p>
                    According to market analysts, the new Windows 8 from Microsoft not generating enough demand for PC to bring positive growth in the PC industry.<br><br>Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis at NPD has said “After just four weeks on the market, it’s still early to place blame on Windows 8 for the ongoing weakness in the PC market,” “We still have the whole holiday selling season ahead of us, but clearly Windows 8 did not prove to be the impetus for a sales turnaround some had hoped for.”<br><br>NPD says since its launch, Windows 8 has captured just over half (58 percent) of Windows computing device unit sales, compared to the 83 percent Windows 7 accounted for four weeks after that launch. Windows 8 tablet sales have been almost non-existent, with unit sales representing less than 1 percent of all Windows 8 device sales to date, as per NPD.
