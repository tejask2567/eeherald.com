                    <p>
                    The requirement for large memory in small space is never ending with personal multimedia information size growing at enormous rate. The most popular NAND flash memory is getting even smaller with 19nm semiconductor process node used by leading NAND flash memory chip maker Toshiba.<br><br>Toshiba Corporation had stated its new 19nm generation process technology can help assemble sixteen 64Gbit NAND flash memory chips in one package and to deliver 128GB devices for application in smartphones and tablet PCs. The 19nm process products are also equipped with Toggle DDR2.0, which enhances data transfer speed.<br><br>Samples of Toshiba 2-bit-per-cell 64-gigabit from Toshiba were said to be available from the end of April 2012 and mass production scheduled for the third quarter of the year (July to September 2011).<br><br>Leading flash storage card vendor Sandisk has said it is using 19nm technolgy chips in its 128GB iNAND Extreme product which measures 12mm by 16mm package-size.<br><br>iNAND conforms to the new e.MMC 4.5 specification and can achieve up to 45 megabyte per second (MB/sec) sequential write and 100 MB/sec read speeds. The new generation of iNAND Extreme also more than doubles the random write performance of previous generations and significantly improves random read performance, claims Sandisk.
