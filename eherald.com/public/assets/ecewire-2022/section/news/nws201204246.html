                    Alvarion Ltd has announced that HotSpot International (HSI) has selected Alvarion's carrier grade Wi-Fi solution for delivering wireless connectivity to hospitality customers across Mexico, and Central America, including AMResorts and the Casa Dorada Los Cabos, resort & spa.<br><br>"Whether for business or pleasure, travelers expect to have wireless connectivity at their fingertips no matter where they land in the world - from the airport to convention center, hotel grounds and even poolside," said Eran Gorev, president and CEO of Alvarion. "At the same time, a proliferation of mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets is putting enormous strain on legacy communications infrastructure. Alvarion easily and cost-effectively addresses these pain-points with its WBSn solution, a family of advanced Beamforming 802.11n Wi-Fi base stations. The WBSn solution, tagged "As Far As Wi-Fi Can Go", is a combination of outdoor and indoor Wi-Fi coverage that provides excellent coverage and capacity everywhere."<br><br>"Alvarion's technology allows us to more effectively and cost-efficiently deliver better high speed wireless connectivity solutions to our customers so that their guests can have a world-class experience," stated Louis Miller, founder and CEO of Hotspot International.<br><br>Alvarion's technology will help HSI deliver more wireless services that can enhance the visitor experience including services that will seamlessly connect VoIP room extensions with visitors' smartphones; monitor assets so items ordered via the wireless network can be delivered wherever guests are on the property; enable guests to change room controls remotely, such as temperature or lights; and allow international calling Wi-Fi hand-offs so guests can avoid costly international roaming charges.
