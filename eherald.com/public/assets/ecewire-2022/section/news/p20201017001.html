                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Pixelwork said in its release that the new OnePlus 8T smartphone uses Pixelworks tech features such as patented high-efficiency color calibration, color management, flesh tone correction and protection, flicker-free screen dimming and ultra-smooth adaptive brightness.  <br><br>OnePlus 8T comes with 6.55 Inch AMOLED display with dynamic 120 Hz refresh rate matching to OnePlus 8 Pro. Other features include 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage with four cameras, a 48 MP main camera, 16 MP wide-angle, 5 MP macro and a 2 MP depth lens. Both the phones rated well for display quality.<br><br>To talk about Pixelworks technology, the new OnePlus 8T smartphone screen automatically adapts its tone to the color temperature of the ambient light to preserve display quality and reduce blue light during   bright sunlight to dark rooms. <br><br> OnePlus 8T smartphone uses Pixelworks patented, high-efficiency calibration software and runs Pixelworks color management software on the display processing unit  in maintaining color accuracy for all apps, use cases and content spanning the sRGB, DCI-P3 and custom color gamuts.<br><br>OnePlus 8T features  what is stated as a finely tuned, 8192-level (8K?) luminance control that can dynamically adapt or be adjusted manually by the user in response to changes in ambient light. This enables ultra-smooth display brightness transitions without screen flashing, particularly in low light environments.<br> DC Dimming 2.0  Reduces eye strain and visual sensitivities that can occur at low brightness on AMOLED screens. To dim the screen, the Pixelworks solution dynamically adjusts the display's current to mitigate the screen flickering associated with conventional Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dimming, as stated by Pixelworks.<br><br>Color accuracy across all display modes is ensured by using True Flesh Tone Calibrated flesh tone correction and protection technology, which enables true-to-life skin tones for pictures and streamed video content.
