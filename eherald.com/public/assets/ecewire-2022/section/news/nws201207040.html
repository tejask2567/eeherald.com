                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    ABI Research has reported global OEM connected car system penetration is expected to increase from 11.4% in 2012 to 60.1% in 2017. While penetration in the US and Western Europe will exceed 80% by 2017, developing regions such as Latin America and Eastern Europe will also see strong increases in telematics penetration in new vehicles, largely driven by mandates in Brazil and Russia, according to ABI.<br><br>VP and practice director Dominique Bonte comments: “In-car connectivity is quickly transforming the automotive industry, enabling passive and active safety and security and offering infotainment and connected lifestyle services to consumers but also enabling new car ownership, usage, and experience modes such as car sharing, (semi)-autonomous driving, dynamic demand-response electric vehicle charging pricing, and customer and vehicle relationship management services including prognostics and preventive maintenance.”<br><br>However, the two main issues the automotive industry continues to face are cost and lack of awareness as illustrated by a recent ABI Research consumer survey.
