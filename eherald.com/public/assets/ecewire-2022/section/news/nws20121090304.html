                    <p>
                    MoSys is presenting at the Linley Group's Linley Tech Processor Conference 2012. MoSys' VP of Technology Innovation and System Applications, Michael Miller, is to discuss how the second generation Bandwidth Engine IC will be twice as efficient and offer more than twice the performance of existing networking memory solutions through a unique combination of technology and device architecture in his presentation, "High-Performance, Power-Effective Bandwidth Engine Memory Solution for Networking Applications."<br><br>What:<br>The Linley Tech Processor Conference is a two-day event delivering in-depth information from analysts and industry leaders on the newest processors for networking and communications with multiple cores, programmable data planes, and flexible architectures. Additional topics consist of network security, CPU design, and high-performance memories for networking.<br><br>"Processor design continues to evolve to address ever-increasing demands for performance and power efficiency; but, as processors evolve, evaluating them becomes more challenging for communications-equipment designers”, said Joseph Byrne, Linley Group senior analyst and conference chairperson. "The Linley Tech Processor Conference, gathers leading processor vendors to deliver vetted presentations about their solutions for developers of enterprise and carrier equipment. These talks, plus keynote speeches and Q&A panels, give attendees the critical information they need to select the best processor for their designs.”<br><br>The seminar is targeted at communications-system designers, network-equipment vendors, OEM/ODMs, carriers/service providers, press, and the financial community. Attendance is free to qualified attendees who register by October 4.<br><br>When:<br>The Conference takes place on October 10-11, 2012<br><br>Where:<br>DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Jose<br>2050 Gateway Place<br>San Jose, CA 95110<br><br>Source: Mosys
