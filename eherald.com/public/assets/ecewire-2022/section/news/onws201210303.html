                    <p>
                    STMicroelectronics India, in association with IEEE Solid State Circuits Society (IEEE-SSCS), Delhi Chapter, is organizing a workshop on Advanced Analog and RF at Greater Noida, India, on October 30-31 2012. The workshop is led by Prof. Bram Nauta from the University of Twente, Netherlands.<br><br>Prof.Nauta is a distinguished IEEE lecturer and an elected member of the IEEE-SSCS Administrative Committee. He is also a member of the technical program committees of the International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), the European Solid State Circuit Conference (ESSCIRC), and the Symposium on VLSI Circuits. Prof. Nautais a co-recipient of the ISSCC 2002 and 2009 "Van Vessem Outstanding Paper Award.<br><br>Vivek Sharma, Regional Vice President, Greater China & South Asia Region – India Operations, Director India Development Centre, STMicroelectronics, said, “We are very pleased and honored to once again host a lecture series of the IEEE Solid State Circuits Society, Delhi Chapter, which is gaining popularity as a flagship SSCS conference and a premier forum for the presentation of advances in solid-state circuits and system-on-chip technologies. The workshop on ‘Advance Analog and RF’led by one of the most acknowledged and renowned members of the IEEE will broaden the knowledge of the engineers working in this field. I would like to thank all members of the organizing committee for their efforts in bringing some of the leading experts and pioneers from industry and academia and putting together quality technical programs, highly sought after by the design engineer community.”<br><br>Dr. Rakesh Kumar, President IEEE-SSCS,said, “As a premier community of Solid-State Circuit activities worldwide we are pleased to support the efforts of our Delhi Chapter. Bringing together distinguished speakers with the local Integrated Circuit community is an important element of the society. We thank STMicroelectronics for their support in hosting this event, the participating companies and individuals.”<br><br>The ST-organized workshop is co-sponsored by Free scale, Agilent Technologies and India’s premier institute of engineering, IIT Delhi. The workshop consists of lectures on Advanced Analog and RF and open forum discussions.<br><br>STMicroelectronics is hosting an IEEE event at its Greater Noida, India premises for the second time. The previous SSCS lecture series, held in July 2012, featured renowned speakers including Prof. Russell Jacob Baker, Dr. Alvin Loke of AMD, Prof. MohamadSawan of Polytechnique Montreal, and Dr. Rakesh Kumar. The hugely successful event, which was also the kick-off meeting of the SSCS-Delhi Chapter, gathered more than 500 participants.<br><br>For further information on the IEEE-SSCS Lecture Colloquia at STMicroelectronics India please go to http://sites.ieee.org/delhi-sscs/details/
