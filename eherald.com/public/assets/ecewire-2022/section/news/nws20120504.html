                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Market research firm Infonetics Research released excerpts from its recent Cloud and CPE managed security services report, which analyzes and forecasts the market for cloud based and CPE based security services delivered by service providers for small, medium, and large businesses.<br><br>"The fact that many new attacks are developed for the web applications means that any device that has a web browser and some form of Internet access is a target," notes Jeff Wilson, principal analyst for security at Infonetics Research. "Companies have to worry about desktops, laptops, servers, smartphones, tablets, kiosks, iPods, set-top boxes, and any other device that can connect to the Internet. The highly distributed nature of Internet-connected devices and the diversity of those devices drives many companies to look at managed services (cloud based services in particular) to provide consistent protection regardless of device type, location, operating system, or browser."<br><br>Infonetics Research forecasts the cloud and CPE managed security services market to grow to ~8 billion by 2016 while it grew 12% in 2011, to $11.7 billion. North America is expected to remain the largest market for managed security solutions for the foreseeable future. The managed security market is driven in large part by 3 major factors:<br>1. Currently installed solutions are not enough<br>2. Many companies lack the manpower or expertise to roll out new technology<br>3. Many enterprises are in the midst of an IT infrastructure transformation, moving users, applications,     and data into the cloud, and seeking security solutions that will follow them.
