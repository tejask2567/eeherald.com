                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Integrated Device Technology has shipped over 2.5M Serial RapidIO switches into customer systems. IDT says Serial RapidIO is deployed in virtually 100 percent of all 4G/LTE systems and 60 percent of new 3G systems worldwide and in China IDT claims RapidIO has captured almost 100 percent of the 3G market.<br><br>"IDT is proud to be the leading supplier of RapidIO interconnect solutions and the recipient of continued customer loyalty. The delivery of 2.5M units is a significant milestone that demonstrates the breadth of RapidIO's deployment," said Tom Sparkman, vice president and general manager of the Communications Division at IDT. "RapidIO excels in performance-driven markets where its protocol advantages in multi-processor peer-to-peer networks offer a compelling value proposition over other interconnects. As the de-facto standard for 4G wireless base stations, we expect the demand for RapidIO solutions to continue to grow."<br><br>"RapidIO has had a significant impact on how 3G and 4G base stations are designed compared with previous generations. The RapidIO standard was driven by many of the wireless OEMs that now make use of it along with the semiconductor and tool vendors that support these OEMs," said Sergis Mushell, principal research analyst at Gartner. "The standard addresses the key performance and reliability requirements for these designs, and the number of RapidIO switches shipped to date is indicative of the penetration of RapidIO within this market."<br><br>RapidIO is driven by the RapidIO Trade Association, a collaborative industry standards organization now developing the RapidIO 10xN specification with bandwidth up to 10 Gbps per lane and links up to 16 lanes wide.
