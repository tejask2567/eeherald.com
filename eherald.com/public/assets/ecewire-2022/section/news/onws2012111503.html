                    <p>
                    Cavium has announced Symmetricom’s SoftClock fully supports both the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) standard as well as the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and has now been certified for operation on Cavium’s OCTEON Fusion.<br><br>Cavium explains Symmetricom’s software-based SCr/SCe NTP/ PTP and sGPS SoftClockoffering, allow small cell designers to integrate one or more synchronization protocols for deployment in varied network topologies. Network operators benefit by having a solution that can be deployed with multiple types of backhaul and quality of service, enhancing the end-user experience and minimizing customer churn. This approach reduces overall costs, enhances time to market, and provides execution flexibility.<br><br>“The OCTEON Fusion processor family, with its market leading performance, continues to gain momentum in the small cell market,” said YJ Kim, General Manager, Infrastructure Processor Group, Cavium. “Cavium is pleased to bring a joint market-ready small cell IEEE 1588 precision timing solution to market with Symmetricom, and to join the Symmetricom SyncWorld Ecosystem.”<br><br>“This relationship enables delivery of best-in-class NTP and PTP SoftClock solution on the base-station-on-a-chip OCTEON Fusion design,” said Manish Gupta, Vice President, Marketing & Business Development at Symmetricom. “We are excited to expand the SyncWorld Small Cells category with the addition of Cavium.”
