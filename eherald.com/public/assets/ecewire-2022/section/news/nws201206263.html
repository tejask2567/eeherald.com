                    <p>
                    The 8th Annual Plastics Electronics Conference (PE2012) — now co-located with SEMICON Europa — has announced a important Conference Committee comprised of industry and academic leaders in the area of organic, printed, flexible and large area electronics. The mission of PE2012 is to bring experts, research institutions, manufacturers, investors, suppliers and other industry stakeholders to speed up plastic electronics from the laboratory to the large-scale, high-volume production.<br><br>“With important breakthroughs in printed and organic displays, lighting, batteries, logic and memory, plastic electronics is poised to scale into a multi-billion dollar industry in the coming years,” said Heinz Kundert, president of SEMI Europe. “The diverse segments that comprise the industry will leverage the materials sciences, process engineering and manufacturing expertise of other large-scale micro and nano-electronics industries prominent at SEMICON Europa. The synergy between plastics electronics innovation with semiconductor, display and thin-film manufacturing resources will accelerate industry growth and transform the electronics industry in the coming years.”<br><br>Conference co-chairs include:<br>1. Prof. Karl Leo, director of Fraunhofer-Institut for Photonic Microsystems, and professor of Optoelectronics at Technische Universität Dresden<br>2. Dr. Bernd Schulte, chief operating officer, AIXTRON<br>3. Prof. Arto Maaninen, vice president of R&D, Microtechnologies and Sensors at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland<br><br>The three important symposiums, chair and committee of PE2012 are given below.<br><br>1. OLED Lighting and Displays<br>I. Symposium Chair: Dr. Mike Hack, vice president and general manager, OLED Lighting and Custom Displays, Universal Display Corporation<br>II. Barry Young, managing director and CEO, OLED Association<br>III. Takatoshi Tsujimura, general manager, Konica Minolta<br><br>2. Flexible and Organic PV<br>I. Symposium Chair: Martin Pfeiffer, Chief Technology Officer, Heliatek<br>II. Dr. Wim Sinke, Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN)<br>III. Dr. Ayodhya N. Tiwari, professor at the D-ITET, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology<br><br>3. Integrated Smart Systems<br>I. Symposium Chair: Luigi Occhipinti, Flexible and Disposable Electronics Programs director, STMicroelectronics<br>II. Dr. John A. Rogers, professor, University of Illinois<br>III. Dr. Karlheinz Bock, professor TU Berlin; acting director, Fraunhoffer EMFT<br><br>SEMICON Europa and Plastic Electronics conference and exhibition provide an exclusive proposition for visitors and exhibitors. More than 350 exhibitors from over 20 countries are expected at the combined SEMICON Europa and Plastic Electronics event.<br><br>SEMI had acquired the Plastics Electronics Conference and Exhibition earlier this year.<br><br>For more information: www.semiconeuropa.org and www.plastic-electronics.org/
