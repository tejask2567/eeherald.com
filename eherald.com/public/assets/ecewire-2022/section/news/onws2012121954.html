                  <p class="title-text"> Imec and Synopsys collaborate on TCAD models of 10nm FinFET </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Imec and Synopsys have collaborated to calibrate Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD models to support the next-generation FinFET devices made at nodes of 10nm. The collaboration will include 3-D modeling of new device architectures and materials that will enable the semiconductor industry to continue to deliver products with higher performance and lower power consumption.<br><br>"Our focus is to address semiconductor device and material challenges at 10 nanometers and beyond," said Aaron Thean, director of the logic program at imec, Inc. "Collaborating with Synopsys, the market and technology leader in TCAD, helps us maximize the impact and reach of our advanced research programs."<br><br>The collaboration between imec and Synopsys specifically focuses on the development and optimization of new device architectures based on FinFETs and tunnel FETs (TFETs). At recently held IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM 2012, San Francisco, USA, December 8-10, 2012), imec presented a paper on the use of stressors to boost carrier mobility, which is critical to scale FinFET devices at 10 nm and beyond. Insights and understanding obtained through the usage of Synopsys' TCAD tools will allow imec to accelerate this research.<br><br>"This expanded collaboration with imec enables us to extend Synopsys' industry-leading TCAD simulation tool for next-generation FinFET device modeling and development," said Howard Ko, general manager and senior vice president of the silicon engineering group at Synopsys. "Imec is recognized worldwide for its expertise, excellent research facilities and industry focus, and our partnership will help to further advance our TCAD solutions."<br><br>Imec has also announced development of ultra-thin hybrid floating gate cell with demonstrated functionality. The results were presented at 2012 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting. Imec says this is an important step for further scaling of NAND Flash technology towards the 10nm half pitch node and beyond.
