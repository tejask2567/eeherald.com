                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    IC Insights in its latest release has announced top 25 fabless semiconductor vendors by revenue in year 2011. The star of this list is China based mobile phone chipmaker Spreadtrum whose revenue has grown by 96% in 2011.<br><br>The finding and analysis shared by IC-Insights include:<br><br>U.S.-based suppliers captured 8 of the top 10 places and 12 of the top 25 positions in the fabless IC supplier ranking for 2011 (Table 1). Combined, the top 25 fabless IC suppliers represented 80% of the $64.9 billion in fabless IC sales last year, up 4 percentage points from 2010. A listing of the top 103 fabless IC suppliers in 2011 was included in IC Insights' March Update, which is part of the subscription to The McClean Report.<br><br>It is worth noting that 2010 was the first year on record that total fabless IC company sales growth did not outperform total IC market growth (a 27% increase for fabless IC companies versus a total IC industry growth rate of 33%). However, fabless IC suppliers were back on track in 2011 as worldwide fabless company IC sales increased 4% as compared to total IC market growth of 1%.<br><br>Overall, 15 of the top 25 fabless IC companies outperformed the total 2011 fabless IC sales growth rate of 4% (Table 2). In fact, eight fabless companies registered double-digit increases in IC sales last year.<br><br>China-based Spreadtrum was the star performer among the fabless IC producers last year, logging an amazing 95% sales jump. Spreadtrum supplies baseband processors and highly integrated CMOS RF transceivers for wireless applications with over 90% of its sales to China-based customers. As was shown in Figure 1, Spreadtrum has risen from being ranked as the 67th largest fabless IC supplier in 2009 to 17th in 2011, a jump of 50 spots in only two years!<br><br>Spreadtrum and ST-Ericsson are both heavily involved in the cellphone marketplace. In contrast to Spreadtrum, ST-Ericsson's IC sales dropped 28% in 2011 after declining by 9% in 2010. The difficult times at the company led to a restructuring in March of 2012 and it is rumored that this was a prelude to eventually putting the company up for sale.<br><br>The 8 top-25 fabless IC companies that registered double-digit growth in 2011 had combined sales of $20.1 billion, up 29% from their combined sales of $15.6 billion in 2010. Overall, these top eight performers increased their combined sales by $4.5 billion last year as compared to a $2.4 billion increase for total fabless IC company sales in 2011. It is obvious that these eight companies are now prime targets for the IC foundries (e.g., TSMC, GlobalFoundries, UMC, Samsung, etc.).<br><br>IC Insights' April Update to The McClean Report (to be released later this month) is dedicated to IC company rankings and includes the top 50 semiconductor, IC, and fabless IC suppliers. Moreover, the top company rankings of MPU, MCU, foundry, flash memory, DRAM, analog, etc., suppliers will also be provided in the April Update.<br>Table1: Fabless ranking by revenue size<br><br>Electronics Engineering Herald<br>Table2: Fabless ranking by revenue growth:<br><br>Company	2010 sales in Million US$	2011 sales in Million US$	Growth rate<br>Spreadtrum	346	674	95<br>Dialog Semiconductor	297	527	77<br>Qualcomm	7204	9910	38<br>MegaChips	337	456	35<br>LSI Corp	1616	2042	26<br>Mstar	1065	1220	15<br>Avago	1187	1341	13<br>Nvidia	3575	3939	10<br>HiSilicon	652	710	9<br>Semtech	403	438	9<br>Broadcom	6589	7160	9<br>Altera	1954	2064	6<br>CSR	801	845	5<br>Realtek Semiconductor	706	742	5<br>SMSC	397	415	5<br>Novatek	1149	1198	4<br>PMC-Sierra	635	654	3<br>AMD	6494	6568	1<br>Silicon Labs	494	492	0<br>Himax	643	633	-2<br>Xilinx	2311	2269	-2<br>Lantiq	550	540	-2<br>Marvell	3592	3445	-4<br>MediaTek	3590	2969	-17<br>ST-Ericsson	1146	825	-28<br>Source: IC Insights
