                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    GL Communications Inc. has released its latest enhanced PacketExpert - a quad port Ethernet / VLAN / MPLS / IP / UDP tester software.<br><br>Speaking to reporters, Mr. Jagdish Vadalia Senior Manager said, "PacketExpert is a portable Quad Port Ethernet / VLAN / MPLS / IP / UDP tester with 4 electrical Ethernet ports (10/100/1000 Mbps) and 2 optical ports (1000 Mbps). It connects to a Notebook PC through a USB 2.0 interface and each port provides independent Ethernet / VLAN / MPLS / IP / UDP testing at wirespeed for applications such as BERT, RFC 2544, and loopback. Now multiple PacketExperts as provided in below picture may be controlled with a single PC."<br><br>He added, "Command line support has also been added. The newly added Command Line Interface (CLI) feature to PacketExpert is in three different modes: Console based CLI, Client Server based CLI, and Windows Client Server based CLI. All functions available through the GUI are available through commands - such as All Port Bert, Bert Loopback, All Port Loopback, and RFC 2544 using any one of the 3 modes."<br><br>Mr. Vadalia further explained, "Console Based CLI is a stand-alone console based application. The user can enter commands in the console prompt, executed and results displayed in the console itself.<br><br>Client-Server based CLI is also a console-based application. But, here, the CLI runs as a console based server, waiting for client commands. The client is also a console-based application that accepts commands through the command line, and executes only one command at a time. It sends the command to the server locally through a local UDP socket, waits for the result of execution and this is useful for automation, where the commands need to be called from a different third-party application. Both client and server must run on the same PC.<br><br>And Windows Client Server (GL Windows Client/Server) based CLI utilizes GL's WCS framework. Client sends the command to the server. Server processes the commands and replies with the results to the client. This does not necessarily require the client and server to run on the same PC. Single GUI/CLI can control multiple PacketExpert hardware units for BERT and Loopback."<br><br>New features<br>1. Capable of generating/receiving Ethernet to IP traffic at wire speed<br><br>2. Capable of handling full wire speed BERT, in both directions, on all available ports.<br><br>3. Easily control multiple hardware units from a single GUI, multiplying the number of ports available     per system<br><br>4. Command Line Interfaces - Console based CLI as well as GL's WCS (Windows Client Server)     based CLI, allowing remote control<br><br>5. Supports Loopback, allowing for easy test setup.<br><br>6. Wire speed BERT and RFC 2544 testing over Framed Ethernet (Layer2), Stacked MPLS (Layer2.5),     IP and UDP. BERT testing is also supported on Layer1.<br><br>7. Support for BERT, RFC 2544 and Loopback testing with stacked VLAN (Q-in-Q) - up to 3 levels<br><br>8. Support for BERT, and RFC 2544 testing with stacked MPLS, up to 3 levels<br><br>9. Support for BERT, Loopback and RFC 2544 testing over IPv6<br><br>10. Supports industry standards PRBS patterns 29-1, 211-1, 215-1, 220-1, 223-1, 229-1, and 231-1,       constant patterns like all ones, all zeroes, alt ones-zeroes and user-defined test patterns ranging       between 1 to 32 bits.<br><br>11. Optional sequence number insertion allows detecting out-of-sequence packets and packet loss.<br><br>12. Error Insertion capability - Single as well as constant rate Bit Error and FCS Error Insertion.<br><br>13. Throughput, back-to-back, latency and frame loss testing as per RFC 2544 for Uni-directional and       Bi-Directional traffic between ports.<br><br>14. Easy to setup and conduct RFC2544 tests using user-defined parameters such as frame size, trial       duration, number of trials, etc.<br><br>15. Real-time results are presented in both tabular as well as graphical format.<br><br>16. Detailed test result reports in PDF and CSV file formats.<br><br>17. Detailed frame statistics in tabular format for all the ports.<br><br>18. User-defined or auto-negotiated electrical ports can operate at 10/100/1000 Mbps line rates in Full       Duplex mode; optical ports can operate at 1000 Mbps line rate in Full Duplex mode only.<br><br>19. Loopback capability for incoming traffic. Both smart loopback (auto layer detection) and selected       user-defined layers loopback capabilities are supported.<br><br>20. Support for frame lengths from 64 bytes to Jumbo frames (up to 2048 bytes).<br>      User-defined header parameters for MAC, VLAN, MPLS, IP and UDP layers.<br><br>21. Support for ARP, Ping, IPv6 etc.<br><br>22. Field upgradeable technology allows tester to stay current with industry trend
