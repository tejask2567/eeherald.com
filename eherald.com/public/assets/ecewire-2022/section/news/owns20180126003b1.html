                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Semiconductor equipment vendor Lam Research  promoted Tim Archer to the position of president while he will continue to serve as chief operating officer (COO) of the company. Martin Anstice, Lam's chief executive officer and current president, will continue as CEO.<br><br>"Tim has played a key role in leading the company through a period of transformational growth," said Mr. Anstice. "The promotion to president is a natural evolution which recognizes Tim's significant leadership to the success of Lam Research and the high-quality and complementary partnership that we share. It is wonderful to recognize his contributions and potential in the Office of the CEO with me; we have the privilege of working alongside an outstanding global leadership community at Lam."<br><br>Mr. Archer was COO of Lam Research since June 2012 after acquiring Novellus Systems, where he held the position of COO of Novellus.
