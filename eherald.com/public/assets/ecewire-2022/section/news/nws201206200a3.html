                  <p class="title-text"> Airfast transistors from Freescale for both small and big base stations </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Freescale Semiconductor has introduced new Airfast transistors designed to enhance the efficiency, peak power and signal bandwidth of all types of base stations. Freescale’s flagship Airfast RF power product line covers each cellular band and supports both small and large cell base station equipments.<br><br>Freescale suggests the network equipment manufacturers and operators can use the small-configuration Airfast RF power solutions that support multiple wireless standards and manage escalating data transmission rates.<br><br>Freescale has also announced a new class of control products called advanced Doherty alignment modules (ADAM) that enables real-time adjustment of phase and amplitude for the optimization of traditional Doherty power amplifiers. These modules complement the Airfast devices to increase power efficiency, output power and linearity across the frequency band.<br><br>Product details:<br>1. AFT09S282N: The 900 MHz, 28V LDMOS product offers state-of-the-art RF performance from 720-960 MHz and delivers 490W load pull peak power in OMNI plastic over-molded packaging.<br>2. AFT18S230S: The 1.8 GHz, 28V RF power LDMOS transistor delivers a symmetric Doherty efficiency of 45 percent and 17 dB of gain at 8 dB OBO. The device, when used in asymmetric Doherty PA’s, is designed to deliver even higher-efficiency performance.<br>3. AFT21S230S: The 2.1 GHz 28V device delivers good efficiency for a 230W-rated RF power LDMOS transistor. The device is housed in a NI-780S-6 package for VBW up to 100 MHz and is designed for use in either symmetric or asymmetric Doherty applications. In symmetric deployment the product is engineered to deliver 45 percent efficiency at 8 dB OBO and 15.5 dB of gain.<br>4. AFT18HW355S: The in-package Doherty device for high-power PCS- and DCS-band applications, delivers 56 dBm of peak power in a single device with efficiency exceeding 48 percent at average power 8 dB OBO. The device is capable of operating at either 1805-1880 MHz or 1930-1995 MHz and uses Freescale’s enhanced video bandwidth technology to enable full-band, multi-carrier operation.<br>5. MMDS25254H ADAM: The gallium arsenide (GaAs) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) allows phase and peaking adjustments from 2300 to 2800 MHz.<br><br>Product families for 700-1000 MHz and 1800-2200 MHz are also in development.<br><br>“The newest additions to Freescale’s Airfast portfolio of RF power solutions deliver substantial leaps forward in linear efficiency and higher power for small cell and macrocell base stations,” said Ritu Favre, vice president and general manager of Freescale’s RF Division. “As the long-time leader in this market and a pioneer in LDMOS technology, Freescale offers customers a broad selection of RF transistors that advance power amplifier performance while reducing cost and design cycles.”
