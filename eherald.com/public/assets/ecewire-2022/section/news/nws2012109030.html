                    <p>
                    Micrium and Mocana have announced the integration of Mocana's NanoSSL module designed to broaden the capability of Micrium's uC/TCP-IP stack.<br><br>Mocana's NanoSSL complements Micrium's uC/TCP-IP stack and with this integrated solution, engineers can focus on innovation and not worry about integrating SSL-based secure communications into their products.<br><br>"Internet connections are found in an increasing number and type of devices," said Christian Legare, Micrium's vice president. "It is easy to imagine that every one of these devices requires security, especially when you consider that even the least of them provide a gateway into your network. This new offer that Mocana and Micrium promote together brings best-in-class Internet connectivity to the embedded design marketplace and builds upon a solid foundation of Micrium's embedded software."<br><br>"Connected devices have evolved where secure communications is now a must," said Mike Siegel, VP of Products for Mocana. "By integrating Mocana's NanoSSL with Micrium's uC/TCP-IP stack, we are providing OEMs with a proven, robust solution that reduces time-to-market and creates a smoother out-of-box experience for engineers. We are excited to be working with Micrium to make it easy for OEMs to deploy secure connected devices."<br><br>Micrium and Mocana are to host a Webinar in October to detail the technical aspects of using SSL in modern embedded designs. Micrium's Web site provides the exact time and date of this event.<br><br>This new SSL offering can be adopted in all levels of embedded products, from home automation devices to flight control systems. They can be purchased directly from Micrium or any one of their distributors.<br><br>Source: Micrium
