                  <p class="title-text"> Mass production of Lithium-ion battery system from Panasonic for home energy storage </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Panasonic Corporation has announced that it will start mass production of lithium-ion battery system in June. This secure system was developed for European homes and is the first time for the company to produce in volume such a system designed for Europe. This move is to strengthen the company's storage battery business in Germany and other European countries. As the governments are cutting prices for solar power, the consumers are allowed to optimize the self-consumption of solar energy generated on their rooftops.<br><br>Last year, Panasonic supplied its lithium-ion battery storage system for the S10 household energy storage system developed by E3/DC, an engineering firm in Germany. Through field tests in Germany, Panasonic is ready to mass-produce the lithium-ion battery system.<br><br>The lithium-ion battery system consists of the Panasonic battery module with nominal capacity of 1.35kWh and a battery management system designed to control charge and discharge of the battery in accordance with customer needs. The battery system stores excess energy generated from the photovoltaic (PV) power system during peak hours of PV generation and discharges the energy as needed, providing a suitable solution as a household battery storage system that helps self-consumption of solar-generated power. It will also enable households to reduce the dependence on grid power and facilitate the further spread of green energy.<br><br>Features:<br>1. The lithium-ion battery system has design life time of 5000 cycles and realizes long-term operation.<br>2. The battery management provides battery status information to the controller of home energy storage      system, which allows users to remotely monitor the status of the system and battery.<br>3. A high capacity and high voltage lithium-ion battery system employs a lithium-ion cell that is     specifically developed for an energy storage application.<br><br>"In Germany, there is a concern that the integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, into the power grid could cause instability in power distribution because of their unpredictable nature," said Mr. Fumitoshi Terashima, director, smart energy systems business unit, Energy Company of Panasonic.<br><br>"With our state-of-art lithium-ion battery technology and high-quality battery management systems, we will promote self-consumption of solar power generated by households as well as reduction of load during peak hours. In so doing, Panasonic aims for a leading position in providing a solution to protect the power grid system."<br><br>In Europe, the lithium-ion battery system is distributed by Smart Energy Systems Department, Mobile Energy Business Division of SANYO Component Europe GmbH.
