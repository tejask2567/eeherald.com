                  <p class="title-text"> Infineon continues its lead in 2011 industrial semiconductor ranking: Semicast </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Semicast Research has reported that according to its latest analysis, Infineon Technologies was the leading semiconductor vendor to the industrial sector in 2011, ahead of Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics.<br><br>In the last two years, there was more than fifty percent revenue increase for semiconductors in the industrial sector reaching to USD 32.4 billion. The highest revenue growth was for analog ICs, LEDs and power discretes. Since 2008, the revenues for semiconductors in the industrial sector have now exceeded those in automotive, a trend which looks set to continue. Accordingly, the industrial sector has risen in importance at many semiconductor companies over the last five years and continues to do so as more vendors investigate the opportunities offered.<br><br>Colin Barnden, principal analyst at Semicast Research and study author, commented “In practice the industrial sector is a collection of markets within a market, encompassing areas as diverse as video surveillance, heart rate monitoring and agricultural machinery. This diverse application and customer base tends to smooth the ups and downs seen in many other verticals resulting in steady growth. Thus while the industrial sector is fragmented and complex, it is also dependable”.<br><br>With an estimated market share of around eight per cent, Infineon Technologies is judged to have been the largest semiconductor supplier to the industrial sector in 2011. Following its purchase of National Semiconductor in 2011, Texas Instruments is judged to have consolidated its position as second largest vendor to this sector. STMicroelectronics, Analog Devices and Renesas Electronics completed the top five.<br><br>The top suppliers in the industrial semiconductor market holds a market share of around five to eight percent in 2011 and thus no one becomes a dominant vendor. The top twenty together is accounting for less than sixty per cent of the total market share. The largest semiconductor vendors tend to be leading suppliers of analog ICs, MCUs or power discretes, which are the largest product categories. Intel is the only manufacturer in the top ten which is not a leading supplier of these products, reflecting its position as the largest supplier of embedded microprocessors to the industrial sector.
