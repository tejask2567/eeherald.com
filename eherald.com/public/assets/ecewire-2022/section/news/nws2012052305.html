                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Berkeley Design Automation, Inc has announced that Etron Technology, Inc. has selected the company's Analog FastSPICE (AFS) platform for characterization and verification of their memory designs for low-power and consumer applications.<br><br>"Etron memory applications require circuit verification with the highest possible accuracy to ensure high quality die," said Bor-Doou Rong, VP at Etron. "We selected the Analog FastSPICE Platform because it delivers nanometer SPICE accuracy 5x-10x faster than traditional SPICE and helps us meet the quality and yield goals for our Known-Good-Die (KGD) and packaged buffer memory designs."<br><br>The company claims that the Analog FastSPICE platform is the world's fastest nanometer circuit verification platform for analog, RF, mixed signal, and custom digital circuits. The AFS platform is said to deliver foundry-certified nanometer SPICE accuracy 5x-10x faster than any other simulator on a single core and an additional 2x-4x performance with multithreading. For circuit characterization, the AFS platform includes the silicon accurate device noise analysis and delivers near-linear performance scaling with the number of cores. For large circuits, it delivers >10M element capacity and mixed- analog-digital co-simulation with Verilog simulators. Available licenses include AFS circuit simulation, AFS transient noise analysis, AFS RF analysis, AFS co-simulation, and AFS nano SPICE.<br><br>"We are excited that Etron selected the Analog FastSPICE Platform for verification of their memory designs," said Ravi Subramanian, president and CEO of Berkeley Design Automation. "Delivering memory ICs and KGD for low power and consumer applications is a significant challenge. Etron's selection of the AFS Platform validates that Berkeley Design Automation is an essential partner to leading edge memory providers."
