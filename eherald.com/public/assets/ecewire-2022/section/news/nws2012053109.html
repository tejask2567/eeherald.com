                    Corning Incorporated has announced that Corning Gorilla Glass 2, the next generation of the company's cover glass, has been designed into the new Samsung GALAXY S III smartphone. This improved glass was first displayed at the Consumer Electronics show held in Las Vegas earlier this year.<br><br>Corning Gorilla Glass 2 enables up to a 20 percent reduction in glass thickness, while maintaining the scratch and damage resistance that consumers demand. Samsung Electronics equipped the GALAXY S III with a 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED display. Corning Gorilla Glass 2 enables the device's slim and sleek design, and helps protect the device display from scratches and bumps.<br><br>Hankil Yoon, senior vice president of global product strategy, Samsung Electronics, said, "Following Samsung and Corning's successful cooperation on the previous GALAXY S series smartphones, we are pleased to offer our customers the thin elegance and refined style of the GALAXY S III using Corning Gorilla Glass 2. New Corning Gorilla Glass 2 is an ideal solution for Samsung's high-quality smartphones, enabling a superior touch experience and a lightweight and slim design, with the damage and scratch resistance consumers have come to expect."<br><br>Haeng-Hee (HH) Lee, president and general manager of Corning Korea Company, Ltd. added, "We are excited about the introduction of Corning Gorilla Glass 2 because it provides device makers with numerous design benefits without sacrificing toughness. With Corning Gorilla Glass 2, Samsung GALAXY S III customers will enjoy an enhanced smartphone experience."<br><br>Corning Gorilla Glass was first introduced in 2007 which had set the industry standard for damage-resistant cover glass. This cover glass is used by more than 30 major brands and designed into more than 750 product models, spanning over 750 million units worldwide.<br><br>For further information about Corning Gorilla Glass www.corninggorillaglass.com
