                    <p>
                    GLOBALFOUNDRIES said its customer u-blox has begun shipping its 7 Global Positioning System System-on-Chip (GPS SoC) based on the foundry’s advanced 65 nanometer (nm) Low Power Enhanced (LPe) RF process technology platform.<br><br>“u-blox was looking for a strong and reliable partner who could support our aggressive product development and time-to-market plan,” said Vice President, Integrated Circuit, u-blox. “We found confidence in partnering with GLOBALFOUNDRIES because of their high level of commitment to customer service excellence. We were convinced that they could offer the right solution for our product.”<br><br>The UBX-G7020 multi-GNSS chip supports all global satellite positioning standards: GPS, GLONASS, QZSS, Compass and Galileo . This chip integrates both RF and baseband subsystems.<br><br>“We are very pleased that u-blox has chosen us to be the foundry partner to manufacture the wafers for their latest GPS chip,” said Muljadi Tantra, Senior Director, Product Marketing, GLOBALFOUNDRIES. “Our 65nm LPe RF process technology is a proven platform ideal for low-power and high-performance SoC solutions used in power-sensitive mobile applications such as GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE receiver, Mobile TV and Digital Radio.”<br><br>Introduced in 2009, GLOBALFOUNDRIES' 65nm LPe RF process solution offers advanced process technology with a suite of RF components, low leakage transistors, VNCAP (metal-oxide-metal capacitor), MIM (metal-insulator-metal capacitor), thick metal inductors and varactors.
