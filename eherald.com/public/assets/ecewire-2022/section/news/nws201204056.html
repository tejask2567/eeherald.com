                    <p>
                    Fairchild Semiconductor licenses Infineon's advanced automotive MOSFET packaging technology H-PSOF (Heatsink Plastic Small Outline Flat Lead), a JEDEC standard TO-Leadless (TO-LL) package (MO-299).<br><br>High-current automotive applications, including battery management for hybrid vehicles, Electric Power Steering (EPS), active alternators and other heavy load electrical systems uses this type of package.<br><br>Advantages of TO-Leadless package<br>· 1st package to enable current capabilities of 300A<br>· Board space benefits compared to the current D2PAK package (>20% smaller; 50% lower package height)<br><br>The latest MOSFET technologies from Fairchild will be deployed by the TO-Leadless power package technology and first samples are expected in 2nd half of 2012 while the production quantities are made available in mid 2013.<br><br>Marion Limmer, vice president of Fairchild's Automotive Business Unit, said "Building on a long history serving the automotive industry, Fairchild Semiconductor is leading the way in addressing the power semiconductor needs of today's automobile manufacturers. By deploying this TO-Leadless power package technology, Fairchild is helping designers leverage the latest low resistance MOSFET technologies, further expanding our presence in the automotive market".<br><br>Jochen Hanebeck, president of the Automotive Division at Infineon Technologies AG, quoted, "With this agreement, the automotive industry benefits from a reliable second-source supplier base for a high-current power device that provides many benefits in terms of space, efficiency and performance. As a technology leader in automotive power applications, Infineon exploits its technical know-how to provide automotive system suppliers with MOSFETs enabling higher efficiency and performance while also minimizing the risk associated with single supplier sourcing".<br><br>Further information on the JEDEC standard of the H-PSOF TO-Leadless package can be found at http://www.jedec.org. search for MO-299A.pdf
