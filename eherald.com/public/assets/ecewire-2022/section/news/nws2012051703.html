                    <p>
                    IHS European Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) summit is to study the challenges and opportunities of bringing content to the new consumer devices.<br><br>IHS says, the emergence of a plethora of Internet connected consumer devices, from web connected TVs to smartphones, is yielding a world of new opportunities for content providers - along with a range of new questions and challenges. These new opportunities involve reshaping the way consumers interact with content services, giving companies a chance to monetize activity in ways never imagined before. On the other hand, content providers must wrestle with uncertainties, such as how to accommodate varying usage models for different types of products.<br><br>To help companies address these issues, Richard Broughton, senior analyst for television research at IHS, will discuss the changes impacting the content business at the upcoming 2012 IHS European Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) Summit.<br><br>Entitled "Merging Content with New Technologies" Broughton's presentation is to focus on issues such as:<br>The evolution of screens, from televisions to PCs, to connected devices<br>How consumers are interacting with content services across multiple devices<br>The challenges of content delivery to new platforms<br>How content companies should think about new technologies<br><br><br>Feeding consumer needs through components: The rise of connected devices also is placing new strains on the technology value chain, presenting challenges for every node - from the component suppliers to the content providers.<br><br>To help companies understand the ramifications of these changes, IHS will host a panel discussion entitled "Silicon to subscribers: How electronic components eventually feed the consumer need".<br><br>Lloyd Kaplan, former chief operating officer of iSuppli and current managing partner for Pacific Global Consulting, will moderate the panel. Panel members will include Dale Ford, head of electronics and semiconductor research for IHS; and Ben Keen, chief analyst for media research at IHS.<br><br>The panel will address the following questions:<br>How is digital content best protected while maintaining accessibility?<br>Who are the new players in content protection and dissemination business?<br>What is the role of electronic component suppliers in producing content-enabled devices?<br>Who are the winners and losers in the media portion of the TMT value chain, and why?<br>What's next in this complex, multibillion-dollar market?<br><br>In addition to an engaging agenda, the event will give attendees a great opportunity to network with representatives of many of the world's leading TMT concerns, as well as with IHS experts and analysts.
