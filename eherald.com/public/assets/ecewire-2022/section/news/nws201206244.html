                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    MIPS Technologies, Inc. has announced that China's RF chip maker Nationz Technologies has licensed MIPS Technologies' MIPS32 M4K processor cores for use in its popular 2.4G RFID-SIM/SD mobile payment products. Nationz has shipped more than million MIPS-Based devices to-date. Nationz is designing its next MIPS-Based chip for mobile payment applications, including Range Controlled Communications (RCC), which goes beyond near-field communications (NFC).<br><br>"We are pleased to continue the use of the highly-regarded MIPS architecture in our line of successful mobile payment solutions, which allow individuals to move towards a non-cash lifestyle," said Zhu Shan, Director of Mobile Payment and RCC Technology Products, Nationz. "By leveraging the cost advantages, high performance and low-power capabilities of the MIPS cores, we are excited to extend the rapid growth of our mobile payment solutions, which have been a great success in China, to the international market."<br><br>"We are delighted to work with Nationz, which holds a leadership position in the China market with its award-winning mobile payment technology," said Gideon Intrater, vice president of marketing, MIPS Technologies. "MIPS continues to gain traction in mobile-related solutions as companies increasingly recognize the performance efficiency benefits of the MIPS architecture. Through innovative licensees like Nationz, we look forward to increasing our global presence in the rapidly expanding mobile payment market."
