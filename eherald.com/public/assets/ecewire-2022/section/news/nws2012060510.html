                    <p>
                    The 65LPe RF CMOS process is based on GLOBALFOUNDRIES' 65nm process. Process and model compatibility between these baseband and RF processes ensures intellectual property designed for baseband products is fully transferrable to the RF CMOS system-on-chip solution. With its suite of RF components, transistors, VNCAP (metal-oxide-metal capacitor), MIM (metal-insulator-metal capacitor), thick metal inductors, and varactors, the 65nm - LPe RF CMOS process provides a platform for SoC solutions. Integrated RF CMOS solutions for Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS can now be developed and manufactured.<br><br>Agilent EEsof works closely with the major RFIC foundries and GoldenGate gets continuously qualified against new or updated process nodes.<br><br>"We are committed to providing our customers dedicated RF design flow support to handle the advanced challenges of today's sophisticated RF designs," said Richard Trihy, director of design methodology at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. "Support for GoldenGate provides our customers access to Agilent's proven expertise in RF and microwave design. As a next step, we are working to qualify Agilent's RFIC solution for the 65nm and 55nm node."<br><br>Agilent's GoldenGate RFIC simulation and analysis software is a simulation, verification and analysis solution for integrated RF circuit design. Its simulation algorithms enable full characterization of complete transceivers prior to tape-out. Momentum is a powerful 3D planar EM simulator for RF passive component design and analysis of high-frequency effects related to on-chip interconnects and other layout structures. Both GoldenGate and Momentum are integrated into the Cadence Virtuoso platform.<br><br>"With the ever-increasing complexity and operating characteristics for next-generation wireless ICs, foundry and EDA collaboration has become essential for successful RFIC designs in leading-edge technology nodes," said Juergen Hartung, foundry program manager of Agilent EEsof EDA. "We will continue to work closely with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to enable our customers to confidently develop leading-edge RF products at advanced nodes."
