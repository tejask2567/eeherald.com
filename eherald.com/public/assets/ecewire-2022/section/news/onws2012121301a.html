                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Radisys, SK Telesys and Mindspeed Technologies have announced a fully integrated carrier-class Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) solution for small cell base stations. SK Telesys has integrated this solution into their small cell product powered by Mindspeed Transcede 3000 system-on-chip (SoC). Developed with software from both Mindspeed and Radisys, the product meets 3GPP Release 9 "Home eNodeB" specifications, including support for self organizing network (SON) features.<br><br>Technology explanation and market data on VoLTE in the release by Mindspeed:<br>VoLTE is the preferred way to carry voice calls over the all-IP LTE network and will be a key deliverable for next generation wireless networks. LTE has initially been rolled out as a data services only, leaving voice to be carried by the current macro based 3G network. According to Informa Research, 98% of carriers agree that small cells are essential to their LTE network rollout, therefore support for VoLTE will be a key feature of small cells as mobile operators look to re-farm their legacy voice spectrum.<br><br>Most LTE deployments use legacy network technologies (Circuit Switched Fall Back, or CSFB) for enabling voice connectivity, which has various drawbacks, including low battery life and network inefficiencies. VoLTE voice calls can have guaranteed bandwidth and quality of service (QoS) which enables "HD voice," using wider bandwidths and better quality codecs to deliver clearer calls than traditional cellular or even landline voice services. The addition of VoLTE to existing deployment verified CSFB capability to the eNodeB solution from Mindspeed and Radisys allows our customers to address requirements both for VoLTE operators and those maintaining circuit-switched voice services.<br><br>"VoLTE has been a critical component of Radisys' corporate strategy since our initial investment in LTE. We are uniquely positioned to deliver VoLTE capabilities as we provide a complete end-to-end LTE solution, from our Trillium TOTALeNodeB small cell software to our VoLTE-enabled Media Resource Function, the MPX-12000, that ensures quality of service," said Todd Mersch, director of product line management at Radisys. "It was a natural evolution for Radisys to enable VoLTE on the Mindspeed platform, to the benefit of our joint customers."<br><br>"VoLTE is an important component of the LTE small cell deployments that we're engaged in with our customers in Korea. Our customers expect small cells to be a natural extension of their macrocell network and include support for the same services, regardless of what layer of the Radio Access Network a user is connected to. By working with Radisys and Mindspeed, we have been able to deliver VoLTE service with the performance and quality consistent with the macro network," said Il-Hyun Sohn, director of research and development at SK Telesys.<br><br>"We see VoLTE as a critical component of small cells as they become widely adopted, and we are pleased to work with our partners to enable this service," said Naser Adas, vice president and general manager of the wireless business unit at Mindspeed. "Mindspeed is demonstrating its small cell SoC technology leadership by enabling advanced solutions which contribute directly to better services for consumers and better economics for mobile operators."
