                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has adopted the latest 4.0 Core version in July, 2010. Along with 4.0 Low Energy (LE) Technology was developed, there is a growth in 4.0 (LE) end product coming out of the market also. TUV Rheinland Hong Kong Bluetooth testing laboratory as the first and the only qualified Bluetooth Qualification Test Facility (BQTF) in Hong Kong, which can handle RF conformance testing, Bluetooth protocol and application profile testing for all Bluetooth specification (BR / EDR, to the latest 4.0 version). The group had assisted a number of chip or module manufactures to obtain the Bluetooth certification for their Bluetooth chip and module under 4.0 core version.<br><br>TUV Rheinland was dedicated in developing the Bluetooth test capability in Greater China region. Following the foot step of TUV Rheinland Taiwan, TUV Rheinland Hong Kong became the second BQTF in Greater China region that can provide testing for all Bluetooth specification (BR / EDR, to the latest 4.0 version) for Bluetooth RF conformance testing and application profile testing in July 2012. In additional, TUV Rheinland Hong Kong is also one of the local certification body (LCB) authorized by Hong Kong Communications Authority who can conduct testing and certification service according to HKCA standard for Telecommunications and ISM product.<br><br>With the well-equipped testing capability of TUV Rheinland, ASUSTek Computer Inc, completed the first 4.0 core Bluetooth qualification for their own brand product Padfone. Vencer Co., Ltd, has also designed a low power Bluetooth Anti-theft key chain (Bluetooth V4.0 Proximity Tag) which based on the Bluetooth low energy technology and was already been certified. The advantage of Vencer 4.0 Proximity Tag is low energy consumption, small and portable which make it easy to carry and can be connected with iPhone 4S via PXP (Proximity Profile) and FMP (Find Me Profile), in order to detect the distance between two devices. Hence, once the distance between the tag and the mobile phone was beyond the certain range, an alarm signal will be issued, in order to prevent the mobile phone being stolen or lost. With the release of these two Bluetooth Specifications (PXP & FMP), more diversely in security monitoring and remote control calling devices can be in the near future.<br><br>With the development of wireless technology, nowadays, beside Bluetooth which was commonly found in mobile phone and computer device, wireless charging technology (Qi) was also become more and more popular in some low power device (e.g. mobile phone). For example, simply placing iPhone 4S with wireless charging receiver backcase on the wireless charging pad, you can charge iPhone 4S without any connection of the adapter or wiring, which fulfills the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) Qi standard requirement and because there is no limitation of the connection interface, Theoretically, it can be used on every devices which support Qi technology.<br><br>TUV Rheinland is also recognized by Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) as a third party Qi Compliance testing laboratory. TUV Rheinland participated in the development of the wireless charging specification and execution of certification service.<br><br>TUV Rheinland Hong Kong is holding a seminar with SIG on 20th July 2012 to provide details on Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy structure, Bluetooth LE Qualification and testing, Introduction to new Bluetooth Logo, Bluetooth Low Energy Technology Application and Future Development and lab tour.<br><br>Source: TUV Rheinland
