                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Due to growth in remote working and distance learning, the demand for notebooks and smart phones are growing, which in turn boosting the demand for DRAM, one of the key essential component of these systems. <br><br>Market researcher Trendforce has forecasted overall DRAM revenue for the 1st Quarter 2021 reached US$19.2 billion, an 8.7% growth QoQ. Due to the demand for PC, mobile, graphics, and special DRAM remains healthy in 2Q21 and also due to new round of procurement from some server manufacturers, TrendForce forecasts a significant QoQ increase in DRAM ASP in 2Q21. In conjunction with increased bit shipment, this price hike will likely drive total DRAM revenue for 2Q21 to increase by more than 20% QoQ.<br><br>Trendforce says the three largest DRAM suppliers  Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron saw QoQ increases of 8.5%, 6.9%, and 9.6%, respectively, in their revenues in 1Q21, although their market shares remained largely unchanged, with only Micron registering a slight gain, at a 23.1% market share. Going forward, the three suppliers’ market shares will unlikely undergo drastic changes in 2Q21.<br><br>Trendforce analysis on other vendors:<br><br>Nanya Tech sees QoQ growth of 21.7% in its revenue for 1Q21, with a corresponding surge in its operating profit margins from 8.8% in 4Q20 to 17.1% in 1Q21. <br><br>Winbond’s DRAM revenue increased by 9% QoQ in 1Q21. <br><br>PSMC’s revenue for 1Q21, which includes only revenue from its in-house PC DRAM products and excludes revenue from its DRAM foundry services, underwent an approximately 7% growth QoQ, though this figure is about 16% if the latter were also included.
