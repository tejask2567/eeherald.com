                    GAN FETs entering high-volume usage in multiple markets such as 5G communication, defence, and electrical vehicle market.  This demand is benefiting device makers as well as semiconductor equipment companies. <br><br> Veeco Instruments said its Propel HVM MOCVD System is selected by GAN FET maker Transphorm for mass production of GaN-based RF (DoD and Commercial/5G) and power electronics Epiwafers. <br><br>Veeco is a semiconductor equipment vendor with expertise in supplying equipments for ion beam, laser annealing, lithography, MOCVD and single wafer etch & clean processes.<br><br>Propel HVM MOCVD System was selected for its capability to deliver cutting-edge process at high-throughput and the lowest cost per wafer compared to other MOCVD systems, as per the company's release statement.<br><br>“Being at the forefront of GaN-based power and 5G devices that offer efficiency and high-power density, requires world-class manufacturing solutions that are capable of scaling to mass production while offering flexibility to continuously innovate,” said Umesh Mishra, Ph.D., chief technology officer and co-founder of Transphorm. “Veeco’s Propel HVM system is uniquely qualified to do that. The multi-reactor, single-wafer technology provides flexibility and exceptional throughput at a low cost of ownership.”<br><br>The Propel system’s single-wafer reactor platform support processing of 6 and 8 inch Gallium Nitride wafers or 2-4 inch wafers in a mini-batch mode. Veeco claims this system accelerates production ramping due to faster recipe capabilities up to 50% quicker than when using traditional batch tools. Veeco’s proprietary TurboDisc technology IsoFlange and SymmHeat technologies employed in this system provide homogeneous laminar flow and uniform temperature profile across the entire wafer to ensure high uniformity and repeatability.<br><br>“We are proud to have our MOCVD technology selected by a pioneer and recognized world leader in the GaN revolution,” commented Ajit Paranjpe, Ph.D., Veeco’s chief technology officer. “Transphorm’s decision to adopt our high-volume MOCVD technology is proof of the system’s uniformity, throughput, repeatability and cost of ownership advantages over batch technology. We appreciate the collaboration with Dr. Lee McCarthy, Dr. Umesh Mishra and Dr. Primit Parikh at Transphorm during their technology evaluation which ultimately led to their valued selection of the Propel HVM platform.”
