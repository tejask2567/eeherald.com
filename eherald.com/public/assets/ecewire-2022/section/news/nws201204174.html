                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    JEDEC solid state technology association has announced that its JC-64 committee for embedded memory storage and removable memory cards has formed a subcommittee focused on the standardization of non-volatile wireless memory. To be chaired by Nokia and vice-chaired by Micron Technology and Samsung Semiconductor, the JC-64.9 subcommittee for wireless memory welcomes interested companies worldwide to participate by joining JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/join-jedec) or calling 703-907-7560 for more information.<br><br>Wireless memory is rapidly emerging as the next generation in data transfer technology, and is intended to enable fast, wireless connectivity with read/write capability between mobile devices (wireless memory hosts) and battery-free memory tags (wireless memory tags).<br><br>"There is currently no standard for this type of high speed, low power wireless data transfer," said Hannu Kauppinen, head of Nokia research center. "Creating a standard is essential to enabling manufacturing, distribution and retail businesses to benefit from the 100+ Mbit/s transfer rates achieved at close proximity, using very low power wireless memory. It will also enable consumers to enjoy new, fast wireless experiences, such as downloading a music album in under 10 seconds in a store."<br><br>"We are confident about our capability for providing wireless mobile applications with more effective storage memory solutions that will enable businesses to have greater flexibility in accommodating new digital applications," said Jim Elliott, vice president, memory marketing and product planning, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. "In capitalizing on the market's rapid adoption of wireless applications, this soon-to-be-standardized technology offers multiple alternatives for sharing and storing content wirelessly, including device-to-device and device-to-accessory connectivity."<br><br>"Wireless memory technology at these capacities will enable innovative use cases to transfer contents to/from mobile devices," said Micron senior director for wireless solutions group R&D, Marco Dallabora. "Standardization activities will focus to create a solution which is memory interface agnostic with respect to the actual structure of the wireless memory tag and wireless memory host."<br><br>John Kelly, JEDEC president, added, "The new wireless memory activity in JC-64 is part of an ongoing effort within JEDEC to extend memory technologies to meet the industry's need for innovative solutions that best meet enterprise and consumer demands. We welcome all interested companies to participate in the development of open industry standards within JEDEC to help enable and grow the market for wireless memory."
