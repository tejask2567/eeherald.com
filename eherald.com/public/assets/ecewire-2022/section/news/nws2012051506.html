                  <p class="title-text"> Common implementation of NVM IP cores by Kilopass for the 130/110nm nodes </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    Kilopass Technology Inc. has announced that SoC designers can select any hard IP core - IP supplied as GDSII hard macro - from the entire library of Kilopass XPM (eXtra Permanent Memory) and Gusto NVM IP, drop it into a design for fabrication at any of eight top tier foundries at the 130/110nm node.<br>Kilopass' NVM IP common implementation for the eight top tier silicon foundries at the 130/110nm process node means designers can use the same interface and achieve the same area at all of the eight foundries at the 130/110nm, thus making foundry mobility far simpler than before.<br><br>"In the past, it might have been possible to move a design from one foundry to another but the size and interface of the NVM IP block would vary from one foundry's process to another. Designers would need to tweak the interface, and accept or redesign for differences in area that individual foundry 130/110nm processes produced," said Lee Cleveland, vice president of engineering at Kilopass Technology Inc. "Kilopass has developed a common implementation at the 130/110nm node that allows all our XPM and Gusto NVM IP cores to be fabricated at any of eight top-tier silicon foundries and deliver the same area using the same interface at each."<br><br>The 2T CMOS anti fuse bit cell enabling Kilopass' common implementation is fabricated in standard CMOS logic process technology without requiring additional process steps or design rule waivers. Given the maturity of the 130/110nm process, the physical design kits (PDK) are industrial baseline thus enabling ease of footprint and pin compatibility across eight foundries while each foundry's GDSII remains unique. Kilopass has ported XPM embedded NVM and Gusto high-density memory to over 40 processes from 180nm to 28nm at pure play foundries and IDMs. Kilopass 2T bit cell undergoes comprehensive high-temperature operating life (HTOL) and high temperature storage life (HTSL) qualification testing. Kilopass NVM IP offerings in 130/110nm include 16-bit register files and 1kb to 128kb XPM IP blocks, and 256Kb to 2Mb Gusto blocks to fit a variety of applications from securely storing copy protection algorithms, security codes, and encryption keys to IP addresses, analog/mixed signal trimming data, and boot code storage.<br><br>"No other NVM IP vendor enables the breadth of NVM IP hard cores over as many pure play foundries as Kilopass at the 130/110nm node," said Linh Hong, vice president of marketing and sales at Kilopass. "We are seeing more multi-foundry strategies deployed by our customers to ensure supply even during foundries' high-capacity periods as well as maintaining cost competitiveness. In addition to delivering high-quality and reliable logic CMOS embedded NVM to our customers, Kilopass' common implementation platform in 130/110nm enables our customers the flexibility without the added cost of reworking the NVM IP to meet their multi-foundry needs."
