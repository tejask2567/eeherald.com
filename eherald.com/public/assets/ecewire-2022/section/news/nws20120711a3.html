                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>
                    imec has said it has made 20.04% efficient solar PV cells using a simpler and cost saving manufacturing process called PERC. Imec has used homogeneous emitter and Silver-single screen-printed front side contacts (65µm finger width), two busbars and an adapted Aluminum back-side metallization to make large-area (125x125mm²) Cz p-type silicon solar PV cell. With this Imec aims to increase the efficiency but at low manufacturing cost.<br><br>These cells were processed at solar cell pre-pilot line equipped with latest industrial equipment and is fully capable of processing 156x156mm² size solar cell wafers. The line is operated in a flexible way with the capacity to process up to several 1,000 wafers per week.<br><br>“A simple and cost effective PERC cell is imec’s answer to short term aspiration of the photovoltaic industry to reduce the cost per Watt peak of silicon solar cells. Our PERC process combines a simple device structure with optimized processing to increase the efficiency,” says Dr. Jef Poortmans, director Photovoltaics research at imec, “We are delighted to have achieved an efficiency of more than 20% for a standard PERC cell, featuring a large-area, only a homogeneous emitter and Ag-screenprinted contacts. This shows our capability of marrying high performance to simplified processes for crystalline Si solar cells.“
