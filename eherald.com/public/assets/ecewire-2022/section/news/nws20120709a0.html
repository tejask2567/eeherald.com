                    ABI Research has analyzed and estimated growth rate of Wi-Fi access points shipment due to telecom mobile service providers integrating Wi-Fi as carrier option in their mobile networks. ABI Research believes that carrier Wi-Fi equipment sales will grow almost ten times from about 650 thousand access points in 2012 to almost 6.8 million in 2017 as the new Wi-Fi standards roll out for mobile networks.<br><br>ABI says Wi-Fi Alliance, Wireless Broadband Alliance, and the GSM Association pushing for standard specifications like Hotspot 2.0 and NGH specifically tailored for carrier integrated Wi-Fi, allowing carriers to treat Wi-Fi as an integral part of their current network footprint.<br><br>By making ANDSF (a 3GPP standard) an intrinsic part of NGH, the GSMA, and WBA are creating a framework which will transform Wi-Fi’s role in cellular networks. “Successful and speedy implementation of ANDSF in NGH is critical to the growth of Carrier Wi-Fi,” says Nick Marshall, principal analyst, mobile networks.<br><br>ABI Research also believes that this growth will be moderated by the availability of suitable backhaul, availability of electrical power at the installation sites/ease of installation, operator acceptance of Wi-Fi, and the effectiveness of network management systems in controlling very large networks of Wi-Fi access points.<br><br>“There are many challenges to be overcome for an operator when considering deploying Wi-Fi as an off-load mechanism with operator enthusiasm for and acceptance of Wi-Fi not yet a given,” comments Marshall.<br><br>With this move into the carrier Wi-Fi segment, Cisco and Ruckus will encroach on market territory currently held by the traditional mobile equipment infrastructure vendors like Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Networks, and Alcatel-Lucent, opines ABI.<br><br>With these new developments traditional mobile infrastructure vendors are positioning themselves for share gains in market territory currently held by the Wi-Fi vendors. Ericsson will encroach on market territory currently held by the traditional Wi-Fi equipment vendors such as Cisco, Aruba, Ruckus, etc. and ABI Research expects market shares to fluctuate as these competitive dynamics play out over the next few years, says ABI.
