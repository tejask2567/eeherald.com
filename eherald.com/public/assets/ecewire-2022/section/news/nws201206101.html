                    It's not just typing and touching a lot more human interface is enabled in the latest smart phone Galaxy S III (3) from Samsung.<br><br>Voice interface:<br>To get more human way Galaxy S III smart phone applies voice interface for user to tell the phone to do activities like 'play music', 'stop alarm', and 'call a number'. Galaxy S III has S-Voice feature to support voice interface.<br><br>sams<br><br>Visual interface:<br>The front camera senses if the user is watching the screen and Galaxy S III changes the display setting accordingly. It's the start of visual interface, there is lot more can happen with visual computing such as identification, shape recognition, image search.<br><br>Motion interface:<br>The motion sensing using MEMS is already well explored for huge number of applications. Galaxy S III features phone pick up sense, call making on phone position (phone at ear).<br><br>On the interesting connectivity feature, with Wi-Fi direct and DLNA, Galaxy S III displays its content on desktop computer, notebook and TV easily.<br><br>What drives all this is the processor performance. Galaxy S III is said to powered by ARM Cortex-A9 processor core based quad core SoC chip Exynos-4.<br><br>The underline trend here is the multimedia graphic, audio and video processing is at the heart of modern mobile convergence (if not computing alone its communicating and entertaining) devices.<br><br>It is the beginning of the computing the way human compute the natural content such as sight, sound, movement and touch. The missing is smell and taste. The e-nose, e-taste are in the labs now and expect them as USP for next mobile devices.<br>.<br>Do you think Galaxy S III beats Apple iPhone? hold on! Apple is the most expert in providing human interface technology. Next version of iPhone will have lot more than what we hear now.<br><br>To know more on the features of Galaxy S 3 visit http://www.samsung.com/in/promotions/galaxys3/index.html
