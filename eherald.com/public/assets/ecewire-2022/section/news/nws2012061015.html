                    <p>
                    SEMI Chemical and Gas Manufacturers Group has organized the 2012 Strategic Materials Conference (SMC) on October 23-24, 2012 in San Jose, California. Electronic device manufacturers, materials suppliers, market analysts, academic researchers and other industry experts will speak and participate in this event.<br><br>SMC is said to be the only conference dedicated to exploring the synergies, trends and business opportunities in advanced electronic materials. Speakers from Intel, IBM, HP, DuPont, Pangaea Ventures, NREL, Lynx Consulting, Sachem, Envirodigm, Plextronics, Techcet Group, and other industry experts would discuss the critical strategic and business dynamics occurring in new and advanced electronic materials.<br><br>The changes and the need for new materials are accelerating in semiconductors, LEDs, PV, energy storage, printed electronics and power devices which create opportunities for performance enhancement and cost reduction. Many of the trends and innovations in one industry are applicable to other industries, creating potential valuable synergies across the micro- and nano- electronic materials spectrum. SMC 2012 explores these issues with presentations from leading market analysts, academic researchers, industry consortiums, leading manufacturers, and material suppliers. The conference also serves as a valuable forecasting tool and an accelerator for advanced materials usage in the electronics industry.<br><br>The 2-day SMC features four 2-hour tracks in semiconductors, carbon-based materials for energy storage and ICs, LED/Power devices, and OLED/printed electronics. Other portions of the conference devotes to critical trends and issues in materials usage and materials development, including rare earth supply dynamics, materials recovery, collaboration models and joint development strategies, investment opportunities, and more. provide Market forecast and insights into application trends will be provided by industry analysts.<br><br>For information and registration, www.semi.org/smc
